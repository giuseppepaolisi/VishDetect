"So there aren't really many companies. There are no companies, but corporations want that kind of marketing, and in the case of large companies, they really go after big companies for marketing and stuff, like advertisements. But small companies don’t have that kind of money, they lack funds, so if a lot of small companies are created, there is a huge demand. So it's a really blue ocean over there. That's why that older brother sold really well, in my opinion.",,0
"I have something like that. These guys really have a different way of thinking, right? I wonder if the kids who use Facebook think differently? I haven't used Facebook since my first year of college, but there's something like that. The kids who use Facebook seem a bit... how should I say it? They don't look very cool? Yeah. Not cool. But I don't understand why Facebook seemed so uncool back then, while Instagram seems so cool.",,0
"Oh. So I was just like, really, you know/ still, we talked about it when we went on the MT. Even when we went on the MT, I heard that they were doing this too, one of the seniors was doing this, so I got really angry. Of course, I can't say that it's all my fault; I also have my shortcomings because I’m human. But they really excluded me from the discussion when they were talking about what they did. So what we talked about back then was that anyway, I said, we’re not going to see each other separately after graduation, right?",,0
"Since I went to school with the purpose of getting a job, I think it would be better for me to go and do it quickly now. Because if I go to school, in my opinion. But my friend is also attending that school, and he said that his major disappeared after he went to the military, so it got merged with another major. So he went as a freshman and started again from freshman year. But his major was a strange major. It was some weird marine something major.",,0
"Is it (5, 3)/(Oh three)? (5, 4)/(Oh san) is right. b/ But b/ I don't know. (3. 2)/(Three point two) or something like that, I could say something about it, right? Instead, b/ I think you just need a defensive argument. b/ Just because your grades are low doesn't mean they are extremely low. That's enough. So what you did was+ what+ what you were more interested in and b/ you definitely showed your passion for that, but in that process b/ you couldn't keep your grades up* that’s how it should be, but b/ if you didn't do that for sure and didn't keep up your grades either, b/ those people would dislike it, right?",,0
"b/ I saw someone else getting hit, not just another person. So I realized it was okay to hit. Then while I was sleeping, in the first period, we had a lot of English, so I just endured it. Then starting from the second period, I started to hit while sleeping, but one day, in the third period, it was all about English, and suddenly while I was sleeping, the kids found out and said they would take away my mat, saying they would give it back on the day of the graduation ceremony. But how many days has it been since the vacation ended? l/",,0
"o/ I can't do anything about it. So b/ Actually, I asked someone else to check for me. There’s a mom in the same class that Seung-ah knows, and b/ that mom said they already had a school uniform sharing event. (2)/(for) 3rd grade/(third grade). b/ But Seung-ah didn't say anything, so damn* since I know that mom, if I just ask, I could get it right away, but b/ she didn't mention it. So b/ I called later and b/ talked about it once. I mentioned Seung-jun's size and things like that, and b/ I've asked for it. But there’s still no word about it yet. b/",,0
"Transferring is tough. Because for transferring, there has to be a gap. You're transferring to fill that gap, usually. I understand that when a student originally at that school leaves, a vacancy is created, and that's when transfers are sought. But our school has quite a few transfer students. However, most transfer students are older. There are some who are twenty-nine, some who are twenty-six, and well, if they're twenty-six, they're somewhat similar to you. They are married, have kids, and some even come in their early thirties.",,0
"I'm not really putting in the effort right now, and the mindset is like ""Oh, it's over now, so let's do some exercise to get in shape,"" I was thinking a bit like that. But now that it's done, I just feel like, I don't want to look for something to do on my own. I just lie down all day, almost. Until before my part-time job. Even when I go to the gym, I just go to the sauna. There's a sauna at the gym, so I just lie there and use the massage chair for about an hour and a half, and I absolutely don't run.",,0
"If that happens, coming out late means that we can take reservations from customers in advance, and if there are peak times when the seats are fully booked, we can take reservations from those customers. Then, those reservation customers can write down their names and numbers while waiting there, and if they also write down which menu they would like to eat, that would be great. If someone later comes and asks if they can choose, we can let them choose, and roughly it will work out to a certain amount.",,0
"They're saying that this is a long-term project, so I have to take the first and second exams simultaneously in March and February, right? But usually, preparing for the second exam takes about a year, and people just prepare for that. But I have to resolve all of this within this year, so I really don't have time. So I probably won't have much time until March, and I don't think I will have much time from February to March either. So, yeah. Almost... I can't even eat.",,0
"o/ It's just that the quantity that can come out by using the full amount is only that much. The Chinese kids can't match that. Those Chinese kids are always all about getting a lot, a lot. When a certain product hits the Chinese market, the response is good, and then they come in and immediately say something like (15 billion)/(백 오십억), or (30 billion)/(삼백억), (50 billion)/(오백억). It's funny because they deal in cash for all of that. They throw it around in cash.",,0
"Eating (4 pieces)/(four pieces), and if (I) eat dessert, (I) will eat dessert a bit heavily, saying that (I) will eat (4 pieces)/(four pieces). b/ And there are also (6 pieces)/(six pieces) b/ so instead of eating (4 pieces)/(four pieces), I enjoy something really expensive b/ and if I eat (8 pieces)/(eight pieces) b/ (they) would follow with all (4)/(four) to split (4 pieces)/(four pieces) each with me b/ n/ and (I) will just add (2 plates)/(two plates) more b/ to eat too b/",,0
"I have to study again, but that means I have to do it again. Of course, the type of study will change. The method will change too, but if it's tougher than during my third year of high school, it definitely won't be easier, right? So, I can't do it. I actually want to retake the exam, but the universities I'm accepted to or want to go to? That sounds strange, right? Anyway, I don't like the universities I can go to. I want to retake the exam, but I don't think I have the strength to go through that time again. Don't you have similar worries for that reason?",,0
"There are many differences. First of all, I feel like the air is different at night, and I've come to Seoul quite often, but I always feel really excited every time I come. It feels like whether I'm coming to work or to have fun, it just feels like I'm coming to have fun, and when I come to have fun, it literally feels like I'm here to have fun. But I think it's really nice. First of all, in the neighborhood, there are so many people I know in Suwon, and if we make a mistake, it's immediately noticeable, so I think Seoul is really nice. I think it would be good to come often in the future.",,0
"b/ Everyone was doing this. All the women at the table. They were really all + so there was that group of six, and there were four, and there was a group of eight, you know? So everyone + they're all women. They all came together, and just as I was about to serve the drinks and open the door, b/ they were all doing this. They were all like this. They were all trying to take selfies. So I was a bit shocked when I saw that. I was like, ""Wow,"" and then I said something to my sister, and she was laughing too.",,0
"I heard you asked. Why did you choose this major? The other person said they chose this major because they think they'll make a lot of money. So, well, if you choose it, you have to take responsibility for what you chose. But you have to put in effort, and since you're not, you're starting to worry. What will you do next semester? So, well, I don't really need to worry about that, but still, I feel a bit worried. Just a little bit.",,0
"o/ b/ But my mother doesn't understand the concept of a PC bang, so there was a time I got caught. b/ After coming back from the PC bang, I smell like smoke, right? So as soon as my mother sees me, she doesn't ask if I went to the PC bang; she asks, ""Did you smoke?"" b/ But my older brother knows. He knows that I secretly went to the PC bang. b/ So he was laughing and saying that it wasn't my fault and that I wouldn't smoke, and I still remember that. n/ In middle school.",,0
"b/ So what, at first it was almost like what + what this is, seriously it might not be real. It could be synthetic, you know? b/ There are like five, but I have only seen two. I even asked the kids b/ and they said some of them have seen all five, so I thought there were only two at first, but it was five. Turns out b/ the kids said it’s so dirty they can’t even mention it, like, b/ but when I see that kind of stuff, I think, damn, the stock market rumors b/ seem pretty strong. Then I start thinking like that again.",,0
"I don’t know if I'm particularly good at it, but do you know about that? When my mom finds a hair salon, she goes there and gets her hair done a few times. Then, my younger sibling and dad get their hair cut every month, right? So since there's nowhere else to go, they’ll go to the place that mom recommended. Suddenly, the whole family becomes exclusive clients of that one hairdresser. So, since my sister goes there, I just go there too because my mom goes there to get her hair done.",,0
"When I was in elementary school (4th grade)/(3rd grade), I had a close friend, but these days, I only see them surviving on Instagram. I was in the same class as that friend in (4th grade)/(3rd grade). But in (4th grade)/(3rd grade), I wore shorts in the summer, and I tend to have a lot of hair on my arms and legs, you know? It's the same on my back. I have a lot of body hair. But now, I was really bored during class, so I kept cutting the hair on my knees and legs with scissors.",,0
"But I know too. / But the reason why is that I know the location of my things. But others think it looks messy when they see it. But from my perspective, everything is organized. So when my mom and dad first came over, it stressed me out because they always wanted me to clean my room. Because all the things I had placed in their locations would disappear. So I thought, ""This doesn't seem right."" But others think I'm really good at organizing and that my books are all neatly arranged, but in reality, I'm not like that.",,0
"But there are things I don't really know, to be honest. Well, I'm not really that interested in British politics or anything; I only know about cars. And like I said before, in our class of 60 people, there's one British person, so I've talked a lot with him since we're somewhat close. But the information I hear mostly comes from him, so when I ask him about the things I'm curious about, I don't really know much.",,0
"Oh, it's a spoiler anime, it's a chain place, you know? b/ Just because it's a chain place, there are a lot of kids who go there, right? b/ Well, if it's a chain, that means it has a middle ground, right? That's correct. b/ If it's a chain place, b/ it wasn't totally awful, right? It's just that it's not extremely good either; that's the typical characteristic of a chain place, right? It's just okay, not great but not terrible either, just average. b/ It's just average. It's just an average gym. I don't really understand why they are so extremely angry about it.",,0
"That 연서 also resembles me a bit, having slightly curly hair. So when you see her, when she lets her hair down, at the kindergarten when she comes out, it looks really frizzy. But I haven't taken her to a hair salon even once so far. I haven't taken her there for anything other than getting a haircut, like for a perm or anything, so I haven't thought about it. But if I were to do it, if I were to take her, she would probably like it, right?",,0
"b/ Nevertheless, they said it would be around that amount. (5,000 won)/(five thousand won) would be fine. b/ If it's (5,000 won)/(five thousand won), I can use it for about (1 week)/(a week) or maybe between that and this + now around 15 days. b/ With the range you’re thinking of, (1 week)/(a week) should be manageable, considering the special nature of the uphill road for (5,000 won)/(five thousand won), you should look at about (1 week)/(a week). b/ If it wears out faster than that, you might have to worry a bit about it, and that’s a bit of a burden for you too.",,0
"I guess I’ll go towards the wedding hall? Just like I was doing before? But these days, there seems to be a trend of wedding halls disappearing, right? Suwon and that area too, as well as Yongin, and the same goes for the first birthday parties. There used to be a lot, but if they disappear, we have to do it in Seoul. But to do it in Seoul, the transportation costs are too high. Just going once costs around 3000 won, and if you round trip, that’s 6000 won. If you think about it for a month, how much is that?",,0
"He was the one filming it for me, you know. But he was the next one in line. So I said, ""Hey, how are you going to do it like that?"" And he said, ""Let me try."" At first, he successfully made the cake. He succeeded. But then it switched to donuts. He had to make five donuts, and he did really well. So he picked them all up, and I was like, ""Oh, but it seems like not many people go that far."" They just said, ""Just jump down.""",,0
"b/ And my mom knows someone who took the essay exam with me this year? b/ We took the essay exam at the same school and I think they didn't even meet the minimum score. b/ So b/ Mom thought that since I met the minimum, I would be fine. But* that person* a/ is really good at it. But b/ I didn't get in, and that person thought they wouldn't get in, but suddenly they got accepted through additional admissions. b/ So you never know when life will turn around, and it feels like someone who seems like they won't make it ends up doing so, while someone who seems like they will doesn't.",,0
"b/ That's right. Honestly, wherever you go, if you pay in cash first, it's more beneficial for them b/ that's how they do it. b/ But actually, we aren't being harmed, right? Of course, they're trying to secure some legal benefits b/ but in reality, it doesn't affect me. b/ And if I do it that way, it's cheaper for me because I end up losing out when I use a card. b/ Because they have to pay more money, so that's a loss for you, and b/ I also have to pay more money, so it's a loss for me too.",,0
"And let's go shopping. Right now Zara, H&M, and 8 Seconds are all having sales, and I went to Zara with my mom yesterday. But actually, the atmosphere wasn't very good because the day before, I came home late. So I thought the mood at home would be bad and that we wouldn't go, but we ended up going. So when we got to Zara, I really went shopping and just bought one dress, but there were a lot of pretty ones. Let's go buy more. But by today, everything will probably be sold out. Actually, it wouldn't make much sense to go anyway.",,0
"They came and had so much fun, drinking and all that, but I was just sitting there, feeling a huge sense of self-doubt starting to set in. Then, Teacher Jeong-do said on Wednesday that he had something to do and would be going home for a bit. So he told us to just stay. Anyway, since there were college guys around, he said he would be back in a moment and left. We were taking a test that day, right? When we came back from the test, Teacher Jeong-do wasn't there. So we ended up having a great time.",,0
"Oh yeah. But it seems like to Dad, the rubbing alcohol is like tiger balm. So when I asked Mom why she applies rubbing alcohol here, she said it helps heal faster. So I applied it, and then Mom came into my room and said, ""Ah, it hurts so much."" It smells because of the rubbing alcohol, and it's stinging my eyes, and Dad is blowing on it. That's what he's doing. So I said, ""Mom, you were laughing when I got hurt, but now that you got hurt, it's a big deal?"" Then Mom felt embarrassed and said that Dad treats her like a child. And then she left.",,0
"o/ If one person goes, then I go too. But since one person goes very well, I end up going as well. Then I go again.   b/ Actually, there weren't really any close friends in Keters for me. The closest ones were Yongju and Hana. But since I ended up hanging out with Hana, I became close with you guys too.   b/ So then, as that happened, I started putting more effort into Keters, and it feels like it's the same thing again. Originally, my feelings towards Eternal were the strongest, then Sangsa, and then Keters.",,0
"Then it seems to be maintained subtly, and I just think that I should do it now, but I’m still just thinking about it and not really committing to it yet. So for now, I’m holding off on it. I think it’s okay, so I’m just not doing it. If later on there’s a good place that I find out about through my surroundings, I’ll let you know. If it’s good and not painful at that time, I can introduce you, so it might be nice to contact each other and go check it out. I don't think it would be bad.",,0
"Yeah, I think it's good to do whatever you enjoy consistently, and that chess and that board game were at our school too, but Heeje couldn't do it because the timing didn't match. At first, I asked for magic tricks, but since magic was also on Mondays, the timing didn't work out, so I didn't do it, but the moms who tried it said it wasn't great. They said you can buy something for just a few thousand won at a stationery store or something and do it all there. They said there’s no need to spend money like that. Ahh.",,0
"What are you asking me about? Are you just trying to find something to criticize? You're asking about the tuition fees, but I haven't even decided on a school yet, so I don't know. When I said I didn't know, they said, ""What? You haven't looked into anything."" They act like they’re preparing for an article and then just stop, right? They said it like that, and I got really, really angry, so I just completely slammed the door and went into my room. But seriously, it’s just so annoying.",,0
"To be precise, when we go around six or seven, the treadmills are really empty. It's like, you know, a bit relaxed? But after the Zumba dance, it’s around ten o’clock. Then there are a lot of people. At that time, the treadmills are definitely full. But even if the treadmills are full, you can just do it before the Zumba dance. If you go and do it before the Zumba dance, there will definitely be treadmills available, seriously. But they just don't like going early.",,0
"Ah, that moment when I was extremely angry is definitely in my top five. It’s probably the second or third place. In my opinion, it's second place. That’s definitely second place. It was something that should never have happened. I was seriously throwing chairs and making a scene, you know? Yeah, that was during my time at the school called ""Bureau"" or ""Grucechun Academy."" They call it BCA for short, and there’s a bit of this wall material that’s not asphalt but kind of like plywood put together, you know?",,0
"I didn't see that, but anyway, there is a 봉 above, and they won't give me a ride. But we were like, ""Why can't you give us a ride? How are we supposed to go home?"" but the driver said no and told us to get off. So it just happened that there were about three people there going in the same direction. At that time, there was a man, and he paid 40,000 won, and I and the female student paid about 20,000 won each, so we went home.",,0
"o/ I, um, yeah. And while I was preparing for the exam, I told the kids. If you're injured and there's an insurance payout of several hundreds of millions, and then a kid who looks like they're in their early twenties comes to me saying, ""Leave it to me,"" compared to someone who looks experienced and is in their forties saying, ""Leave it to me,"" who would you trust? Honestly, I would trust the person in their forties. b/ I actually said that too. b/ So now, um, I actually feel like I fell short.",,0
"o/ And the Wi-Fi is not working, l/ Ah/ With the laptop in hand, ready to hit someone because the Wi-Fi is not working, it's a bit like that? Something like/ they applied for a program, and they're angry about why their application didn't go through, they clicked it, and now, well/ if there's a lecture that says it can take up to twenty people, then it exceeds twenty people, right? So* some of them are the twenty-first+ person. Then they're angry about why they're the twenty-first person, people who came in angry.",,0
"b/ Back when we were young, we just went to Gyeongju following Teacher b/ In+ (the teacher). I was just b/ Ah, I’m tired. I want to go to the accommodation. We went like that. b/ But this time, I got my Korean history (Level 3). b/ So I really want to visit Gyeongju properly. b/ I want to look at some cultural relics b/ and while checking those out, b/ our country’s Gyeongju has the most artifacts, right? b/ Back then, I was just thinking b/ Oh, when do we go home, when do we go to the accommodation, but now I really want to go and see it properly.",,0
"In the first year, the first semester and the second semester are like this. In the first year, the first semester and the second semester are about earning credits, and from the first semester of the second year, they said that the transferred students have to pay 100,000 won a month and then train in the academy, and then they have to go through the season again.",,0
"In the past, I started using those sites after seeing my coworkers at that company using them. I saw that they mostly use those two sites. It seems like I could choose from there, and sometimes when I look at places like Coupang, or back in the day like Coupang, for example, it would be 5,000 won. But sometimes, it would go up on sale just like 9,000 won or 10,000 won. So back then, I would buy that.",,0
"Oh. I just did it. After getting permission, I just used the space entirely. So I was like, wow, and I was really bothered, but since I had to do it, I ended up doing it unwillingly and making things like a group plan and decorating. Back then, what I did was using my voice, which was a bit easier. I didn't have to worry about other things. I just acted things like wing chiki chiki chiki or something like that.",,0
"o/ But that/ returning school buff usually happens when kids who went to military service start their (2nd year)/(second year) after finishing (1st year)/(first year). b/ But I've already finished everything up to (2nd year)/(second year) and completed (1st semester)/(first semester) of (3rd year)/(third year), so b/ what's left are really hard subjects. b/ But I wonder if I can just do that right after coming back; I'm a bit worried now. I feel like I've forgotten everything, honestly speaking, I'm currently in a state of forgetting.",,0
"It seems like that method is not bad either. Actually, you will get to know the salary, like how much you'll be earning. You'll hear about the working environment too. They say that team is really good. I mean, they also talk about things like what kind of work you'll be doing. You get a general idea of that. Of course, when you first start working, I have no idea what it'll be like. Anyway, if you feel the atmosphere and it's not bad, I think you can just go with it while working.",,0
"That's right. I went down this time, and originally it was b/ round trip. We can only go on the (2nd)/(second) line. Only the (3rd)/(third) line and (4th)/(fourth) line have cars traveling. b/ So, if there's a car going slowly in front, we almost all overtake and go. All the cars, b/ me too, and my dad too, do that. b/ But this time there was a serious accident, and a few family members died. b/ So, in between, to prevent that kind of overtaking, b/ there are orange cones, right? They set all of those up this time.",,0
"Uh, uh, rather than completion, in the past, when I recorded b/ (1st)/(day 1), I said I would complete it in my own way, but I got criticized by the teacher. But this time, the b/ drawing was uh/ drawn like that, but when I said I couldn't do it this way and that it needed to be more detailed and more fun, in conclusion, it ended up not being properly completed. I'm still thinking about it. Because if I keep b/ acting b/, it eventually sticks to my mouth, and I end up just saying it without thinking.",,0
"Yeah. It seems like that family is getting a bit lonely. When I see those kinds of people, I remember someone I know who works in investment. Their dad told them that they can only see him about once a month. Because of that, they and their mom are always traveling together like two outcasts, so they don't think much of their parents. It's because they can't spend time with their family and are just making a lot of money but can't be together. So it seems difficult for those people to spend time with their families.",,0
"b/ But they said that back in their day, it was never like that at all. On the contrary, since corporal punishment was banned, when teachers did it, parents would make a fuss about it. b/ I still remember when I was in elementary school (6th grade) or something like that, I was having a great time playing with a friend, and then we ended up fighting. We were cursing, even though we were elementary school students. b/ But the teacher was a male teacher, and he was a bit scary. b/ When the teacher heard that, suddenly, I don't know if he was already in a bad mood, but hearing our conversation seemed to make him even angrier.",,0
"Oh, I see. You have to undergo chemotherapy, and you have to do radiation therapy too. There’s so much to do, and just doing that all day is really tough, so how can you be discharged? Did they say you can’t use your hands? Isn’t that something you’re deliberately not talking about, unless it’s your dad? You know, right? So maybe they just suggested you be discharged to spend the remaining time a bit more comfortably and happily at home? Look into it. Why are you so uninterested? Still, you know someone, even if just a little. Just a little.",,0
"Thank you. Oh, and I recently found a second-hand curling iron (40mm) on a marketplace? But this time I want to buy one that’s about (31mm). So I looked it up and the ones with a comb are in the (40,000 won) range, and the other ones are in the (30,000 won) high range. But I already have (2 curling irons), and I didn’t want to use that either. So I looked it up. And I found one on the second-hand marketplace? So I bought it for (15,000 won).",,0
"I did it. I will be doing it. Because he talks about taking medication every day and he even said he goes to the hospital. Even if he doesn’t go, it’s a problem. Then, talking about putting in effort to get an exemption while not actually making any effort is still not right. So both sides don't make sense. Well, then, if it's not precisely the case, he should just go to the military cleanly or, like he talked about his mandatory firefighting, just go accurately or just not go if he can't.",,0
"b/ I'm really meeting well. That* I see the kid every day these days. But I can't see them for long b/ uh/ Now it takes about (10 minutes)/ (십 분) by bus to my house? Usually, I match it with the time when studying ends and b/ uh/ see their face, walk a bit, and then send them in b/ just seeing each other briefly for (30 minutes)/ (삼십 분)?

"o/ If we talk about rights and such, when we generally discuss rights, it tends to happen when an event occurs in an individual's life. b/ However, from the perspective of a couple living an everyday life without such events like me, b/ it's a very vague talk when it comes to rights and things like that, because I currently use them without realizing it. Despite that, it's expressed as a sense of stability because there are things that are provided, it's an emotional matter.",,0
"I only changed the name, and I took the class last time, but it turned out to be different from what I expected, so I can't retake it. I need to fill my credits, so I applied without knowing that the name had changed, and when I clicked on it on the day of course registration, a message popped up saying that I can't retake the same subject. I was like, ""Huh? What? I've never taken this before?"" Then I realized it had changed to a different course, so I thought, ""Oh no, I'm screwed,"" and quickly grabbed another one.",,0
"Because if you just think of it as a mock exam, wouldn’t it be something like this level of Konkuk University, the line of Kwandong Hongseong? But now, it’s completely messed up, so to be honest, even Seoul + Seonggu + the Seoul area is not stable at all, right? Honestly, right now. So I still can’t believe it. I don’t know if this is reality. I really talk to my mom every day. Is this really a dream? I keep telling her to wake me up. But it's not a dream; this is reality.",,0
"But isn't that ten thousand won? We can't just give that. When we work at the convenience store, we also check the cash register, right? We match the money. Honestly, if it's about the convenience store part-time job or an individual owner, there aren't many people, right? So honestly, if it's a thousand won or five hundred won, the part-timers think it's their mistake and try to fill it up. They can fill it up to that extent, like five hundred won or a thousand won, but originally, part-timers shouldn't fill it up. That's stipulated by law.",,0
"I also took out my phone right away and called 119. But you know, I'm actually getting more calm right now. Here at Changdong Station, it's the stairs between changing from Line 4 to Line 1, and there were two men who collapsed here. One man was bleeding from his leg, and the other couldn't get up. So I called right away. As soon as there was a report coming in to 119 because of this, so...",,0
"But, since I don't like him, I end up disliking everything about him. He just seems like a bad guy to me. But then again, I saw him with his mother, and he was in his hometown. I saw him passing by with his mother. Watching that made me think, ""Oh, he's also someone's son in a family."" So I started to wonder if I hadn't been too harsh in my judgment. Have you ever had a selfish thought?",,0
"b/ So we finished it in English, but the fact that we changed grades coincidentally meant we had to face (2nd grade)/(this grade) again. b/ But that teacher had a double major in physical education. b/ So in (3rd grade)/(third grade), b/ they said they would move from English to their double major, physical education, so it became another opportunity to change grades, but they followed us again. b/ So we were probably marked for (3 years)/(three years) straight, and the teacher probably knew the names of almost all the students in the school, right?",,0
"I ate a sweet potato yesterday when I was about to take that picture and send it. So there’s a diet, and I placed the sweet potato slightly next to it. I just mentioned it beforehand. Oh, the one on the left is a sweet potato. I said that. Then b said, ""Oh, you can just eat one sweet potato,"" so I said, ""I'm sorry, but this sweet potato was brought from the countryside, and it's so delicious, can I eat the sweet potato instead of having a shake for a snack?"" I said that. Then b said, ""No, you can't.""",,0
"Anyway, I did a part-time job as a Pokémon trainer last week. b/ I was really surprised that we were doing Pokémon and working in Dungeon & Fighter. b/ I seriously thought my eyes would fall out for four days, but what was even more surprising was that kids came who you wouldn't expect to be like that. u/ Some of them admit it, but b/ they’re like, you know, with characters u/ and like, handing in cards and stuff. b/ It just doesn’t make sense to me.",,0
"o/ Still, I had that kind of opportunity. And you can still, even now, enter the semester a bit, right? There were a lot of kids who entered in their second year, right? I did the opposite. Because our department, well, the department I was in was a liberal arts major, and then in the second year, I transferred to a different school and a different department. But when I went there, all the kids were entering again. They recruit again in the second year too.",,0
"I also think it’s a bit like that when I listen to what you’re saying, but if I don't have any interest, it would be hard to find it. However, if I have some level of interest, I realize that what I want to enter is also being done. For example, on Instagram, at least if I do a name search, even if there are dozens of people with the same name, if I want to find this person, I would go in one by one to see if this person is the right one, right?",,0
"So there are several types of cars. There are big ones, and then there are smaller ones that are even smaller than that, and there are also small ones that look a bit like vans. There are several of those. I keep going back and forth with them, but when I get off, I usually get off with a bigger bus. So there are many types of buses, and they have the buses lined up. And over there, in Sangam-dong, they keep coming and going like that. So the bus system is well established, so going back and forth doesn't really seem to be a problem.",,0
"But, I think it's good that older people are using platforms like YouTube to communicate with younger people. It helps narrow the age gap a bit, and older individuals often want to engage in what younger people are doing. On the other hand, younger people might dislike older individuals, but by doing this, they become more familiar with each other. I think YouTube plays a very positive role in that.",,0
"And the lettuce was all kind of wilted, and the kids were just lying there helplessly. It was really not good back then. So after that, I didn't go to Hongdae for a while. Then when I went there, Mapo was just so-so, but for that price range, it was decent. It's not like I have to come here all the time because it's so great.

"o/ Then I guess I should talk about the exam. Uh. Since I passed the first test last year from March, now I just have to focus on the second test this year. So I went to Spain in February.

"At least 300 a month, I saw that advertisement last time and clicked on it without thinking because it popped up. But it was an installment advertisement for 36 months.

"In our department, most of the time we work on assignments alone, but as I mentioned earlier, in the case of experimental subjects, it's a minimum of 2 to 3 people. So, in those cases, if everyone works hard together, it should be fine.

"Alright. You're right about that. But it's not the humanities you mentioned. Personally, the science field should be good at the humanities. So personally, I prefer reading science books or maybe something in between science and history rather than novels right now. It's better to know those kinds of things personally. Of course, now the fourth industrial revolution is about to arrive, right? Personally, you need to read a lot about science.",,0

"We have a professor like that too, but I took that professor last semester. But it's a required course, and it's even mandatory. My course registration failed, so I had no choice but to take it, since if I don't take it then, I would have to take it with lower grades later. I can't take that on top of not being able to take the essential major courses. If I can't take this required one, I'm really in trouble. So I just thought, ""I just have to do it.""

"But when I went yesterday, I heard that the learning card support is all done, and no longer provides support. They won't provide the allowance (300,000 won).

"Yeah. But isn't it just (2,900 won) a month? If you're just using it for that month, isn't it okay? You can only do one place a day anyway. You could really say it's quite a rip-off. But it's really fun. If you want to try out a song, just search for b/ Rasputin, and that Russian song will come up, you know? It's really famous in our country.

"But when I went there last time, I felt like it used to be richer in flavor back in the day, but when I went last time, it was a bit watery. The food itself was a bit watery, so I was thinking, ""Oh, today is not great?"" and left. I was a bit worried that it might be like that again, but luckily I was hungry, so I don't know if it was because of that, but it was super delicious. I just inhaled it, and then I went out.

After that, starting from the 17th to the 24th, I’ll have five days, so I need to hit it hard then, like three times.

"But the reason why students go to specialized high schools or autonomous high schools is because they write personal statements and things like that really well. In regular high schools, teachers don't manage those things. So when applying for college admissions, what gives them an advantage is that their personal statements are exceptionally well written, rather than just their grades. Since they are applying through regular admissions, they don't have to worry about their grades, and they've received a lot of support for studying for their grades, plus they write personal statements extremely well. Therefore, there are still talks about how students who study can rely on that written aspect.",,0
"But from what I see, one of them is in the academic society, but she doesn’t participate in any of the activities; she only participates in the press club.

"I don't know, I honestly don't know, but if you say you're going to be a personal YouTuber, there are three stages to it. The first stage is an interview. You choose an academy and decide on the academy during the interview, and in the second stage, you start attending the academy while earning money. Then in the third stage, they help you get a job. So if you seriously say you're going to do personal YouTube, you might end up finishing in the second stage.",,0
"I have also been taking personal art classes for about a year now. The reason is that since I’m doing taekwondo, the schedules don’t align. I tried consulting at an art academy called Art and Art, but the time slots didn’t match, so I switched to personal art classes. There are some advantages to this. One advantage is that since the teacher sees me one-on-one, they provide detailed feedback, but the downside is that I have no friends, so my child is a bit bored because there are no friends.",,0
"I looked into the Myeongdong branch and checked out some pictures, and it was cleaner than I expected, you know? But somehow, when I think of Myeongdong, I feel like there are a lot of Chinese tourists coming in groups, and they come for surgeries as well, in groups. They also come for health check-ups like that. So, it gave me that kind of feeling because it's in Myeongdong. But then, when I saw the pictures of the Gangnam branch, it looked really neat. By the way, these days, a lot of Chinese people come for health check-ups from overseas.",,0

I'm coming home late, and I have to meet friends, go to private tutoring, and work part-time, so I come home late and don't eat home-cooked meals, and I don't talk to my mom.

"That's right. When you go on a trip, people often say that it's hard to go just once, and after you go, you want to keep going. But I really felt that personally, and definitely, when you go on a trip, I mean, if you go on a free trip rather than a package tour, your perspective definitely broadens. And when you travel freely with those people, you can directly experience their culture, whereas a package tour just rushes through the itinerary.",,0
"I was really surprised. b/ Also, one time I mentioned earlier, b/ the/ just a normal middle school b/ subject teacher said the kids were being too loud. b/ So you guys+ you were talking a lot and / sleeping, and if you don't pay attention in class, b/ I'll take a picture+ take a picture with my phone and uh/ send it to your parents, I said. b/ So they did it.

"That's different from just analyzing water quality + water quality; anyway, it's safety management. Then they go and ask about that, like, ""Why aren't you analyzing things like water quality measurements as you originally planned?"" They ask why you came to the safety management duties on-site. So, they said, ""Ah, you can't just pick that up."" So, I heard that you need to prepare something regarding that. But then, when I listen to other professors, there are articles.",,0
"If I just go out, it's a loss. So I was thinking of making them work for about three years. But, as you know, the salary at a tax office is really low.

My friend, when he first went to a tax office, they said they would give him two hundred, and two hundred is actually a lot to receive from a tax office. But now he...",,0
"So, if I explain the exact situation, there was a person responsible for hiring them, right? They were hired through an interview. They worked for a day, and then that responsible person went on a short vacation or maybe went on a family trip. So, at the meat restaurant, the person with the authority changed, in a way. The responsible person who had the power no longer needed them because they weren't the one who hired them. So, they were fired.",,0
"I think it would be okay to take some time to watch it at least once. The ticket price is now two thousand won for adults. Paying the full two thousand won feels a bit much, so maybe a discount? Early morning? Or late night? Watching it that way wouldn't be bad, right? But honestly, even at two thousand won, I feel like any movie is expensive, so there is quite a difference in how I perceive it compared to when it was eight thousand won or when it was twelve thousand won; of course, it's not a huge amount difference, but the front row changes.",,0
"I think that's right. High school students are at the age of 20, and they are just about to enter college, while I'm someone who has just started college, so if I talk about my experiences in college, they seem to like that, so I can share those stories. But now, I've already finished college, so I don't really have the feeling of just starting college anymore, and I don't have anything particularly interesting to say about it. So when I think about it, I don't really have much to tell the kids.",,0

"So, in the New Year's address, he keeps mentioning how he will deal with North Korea, but when it comes to the economy and such, he says we are doing well.

"During the weekend, due to the characteristics of our club, each school holds events like badminton tournaments. Each school holds them, and there are events like MT or graduation ceremonies, and activities with current students, outings, and so many things.

"I kind of don't understand why they're targeting those people who run macros or that kind of freedom that's a symbol of freedom, right? In a way?

I was curious, so I asked about it.",,0
"I know, but that teacher only comes during science class time and is not even the homeroom teacher, so I thought they might not remember me.

"But that chicken place was doing really poorly, so these detectives bought it. The building's owner handed it over because the business failed.

The chicken was so delicious that it turned into a popular restaurant, and since lots of people started coming, the detectives couldn't conduct their investigation properly. They had to sell chicken every day, which is a bit comical, but in the end, they managed to catch them. It's interesting, so I want to watch it once.",,0

"Honestly, I’ve tried a lot of things, but in the end, I think it's really about choosing what suits you best.

Then they really gave that up and started doing what they truly wanted to do, and there are people who feel a lot of satisfaction from that. Most of such cases are really common, so I’m very inspired by that and I'm really trying hard to look for it. I still have some time, so.",,0
"It has to open up, and in reality, it means that a lot of things are needed in that situation.

I only found out because he told me. So when he said he came in, I was like, ""Oh, he said he heard him."" He kept chattering behind about it to his mom. Well, honestly, since it was subtitles, the kids wouldn’t really be able to read at that age, so he must have been chattering to his mom. ""Mom, what did he say?""

"If you eat that, you will lose weight, but is it like two cups a day? If you drink it, you'll just lose weight because it breaks down fat. I really want to buy that.

"From my perspective, there's absolutely no bad intent toward you; at least, that's not the case. There's no work involved.

It’s a type where he only talks about what he sees clearly without fully understanding. I can tell that just by looking at it. But I’ve known that guy for a long time, and since he’s two years older than me, no matter what he says, I don't respond back.

That's what I heard, so b/ at that time, the card gave a discount of 6,000 won, and if it's over 10,000 won, b/ it would be 13,000 won, but if you subtract the 2,000 won, it's 11,000 won, so b/ if you subtract the 6,000 won from that, it's considered to be 5,000 won per ticket.",,0
"Parents can enjoy plenty of leisure time while the kids have fun playing in the water, so it's really great. And right next to it, there are places like DFC and Galleria for shopping. Even if you don't buy anything, it's well organized, and you can just take a bus-like trolley with the kids to check out the city. It's also good for simple shopping with the kids there.

"Oh, I'm at this level, and while saying that, I keep picking up one more thing.

Anyway, what I want to say is that the two are different stories.",,0
"I’m not surprised by that. It's just that when you do what you really want, like for me, resting isn’t just lying down; it’s doing sports or doing things I enjoy.

"I think it’s true that if you want something too desperately, it may not come true. That’s why they say about first love.

"At that time, the Arabs were unified, unified as the Abbasid dynasty, and under the pretext of maintaining legitimacy in Khalid, they were expanding their territory. Just like China is doing now.

"The child doesn't finish the essay test, but rather takes it after the CSAT is over, so there is a little time from after the CSAT until the essay (1 week)/(this week) (2 weeks)/(this week)?

"Yes, customer, this is Assistant Manager Kim Seong-do. Yes, two legal advisors have been assigned now. Yes, yes. What is being verified now? Yes, yes, I am preparing it now. Yes, I see. Just a moment. First, I will guide one of the legal advisors. Can you take notes? Yes, please go ahead. Yes, yes, this is OOO won. Just a moment. You have been assigned to KB Kookmin Bank. Yes, Kookmin. OOOOO. Let me call it out. Yes, OOOOO. What is your name? Yes, it's Legal Advisor OOO. Yes, I will send it now and call you right away. It's OOO. Yes, I will make the deposit and call you immediately. OOO is for ninety-eight thousand won. Yes, ninety-eight thousand won. Yes, the remaining balance of one hundred fifty-two thousand won needs to be assigned to another legal advisor. Legal Advisor OOO will finish work on time today since it’s Friday. Yes, for now, Legal Advisor OOO is ninety-eight thousand won. Yes, I understand. What about the remaining part? First, after processing the repayment of ninety-eight thousand won for Legal Advisor OOO, please make a call right away. I am also requesting for the legal advisor assignment quickly. Yes, yes. I will confirm the receipt by six o'clock on Friday, and I will assist you to ensure there are no issues with receiving funds by six-thirty. Yes, yes, thank you for your hard work as well. Yes, regarding the balance of one hundred fifty-two thousand won, please help me with that once it's assigned. Yes, yes, I understand. Yes, yes.",,1
"I will confirm your name. First, I need to check if you have suffered any financial losses due to the emergence of a dummy account. Yes, regarding the second point, I need to see if you are transferring funds to another account to avoid investigation, for example, even if a dummy account occurs. I will need to investigate the accounts going forward, and if a dummy account suddenly generates interest, it will be confusing, and you might think you have sustained damage. From our perspective, I need to determine if you attempted to make a transfer to avoid being traced. If an account is setup, it could complicate the process further. Yes, regarding the content of the dummy account, as I explained, it doesn't matter how much balance is in the account. The amount of money isn't the issue. Yes, I need to check if I can really withdraw the amount I want. If, when I attempt to withdraw, the money doesn't come out as expected, the involved party will realize that it is a dummy account, and that can lead to further deductions. Right, so you need to visit the Nonghyup bank in person, but I cannot go with your bankbook and withdraw money myself. Yes, that doesn’t make sense. It's possibly inconvenient to go to the bank. No, I think I can visit tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes. I should visit today while undergoing the investigation, but is that not possible? I am at work, so I can manage it. Yes, discuss it with your supervisor first and see if that would be okay. Otherwise, the investigation I am conducting is focused on the financial sector. If you have suffered a loss, I am responsible for that. If you ask how I conducted the investigation and how it was wrapped up, I cannot return your funds. Even if you suffered a financial loss, what can I do about it since you still went through the investigation? I cannot give you my belongings. Yes, I cannot give my money as I am also a victim, and I could also sustain losses. Therefore, if possible, I think it would be good to ask your supervisor for understanding. Please discuss with them, and regardless of your work, the investigation must be conducted. We aren't doing this coercively. As I mentioned earlier, if you can, having a phone investigation is good, but if possible, it would be best to take time out and meet with a personal lawyer for a proper investigation. Ah, I see. So, you should understand these aspects as we are conducting the investigation and we don’t want to do it forcibly. That could be uncomfortable, so it is better to proceed with your consent. I need to go to the bank, as my bankbook is at home. What I can confirm is that, for example, when I give my bankbook to a bank employee who is conducting an investigation, there are individuals who ask, ""How much money do I currently have?"" For instance, I give the bankbook with a balance of one million won and ask how much is in this account. Of course, they will straightforwardly answer as they see it, saying, ""You have one million won in this account."" However, this is just a number. If I really need money, I need to check whether I can withdraw it. The fact that they only confirm the money without saying that it is a dummy account is an error. Should I withdraw everything then? For now, you should attempt to withdraw, but your account will soon be checked by the Financial Supervisory Service. I need to track how your name may be misused, so I will perform this check. Yes, you should check the dummy account. There is a procedure for that. If this procedure does not go through, there is not much I can do to assist you, as I am not a bank employee. Right, if I were the branch manager, I would check it myself. However, since I'm not in the banking sector, please legally verify the account. If you can, communicate with your supervisor, but if something urgent happens, you could just say you need to step out briefly. You should still check before the end of the week. Then, you aren't saying you have sustained losses in your account, right? Yes, that's correct. Therefore, making the remaining deposits should not be a problem. But I cannot leave entirely for that bank visit. Yes, you can step out briefly. You should discuss this with your supervisor since that will allow you to go. Right, I think I should first communicate with my supervisor. Then, even if I approach them as a third party, they might be concerned about your situation, so it would be better if you only mention leaving for bank matters. It might be concerning for them to hear that you've been under investigation, so that could be complicated. Yes, indeed. So, I will give you time to talk to your supervisor. Once you do, remember to take basic items with you, like your ID or a notepad—maybe a bag too. Yes, please remember to take your bag. Understood. I will give you time. Please don't hang up; once you finish talking to your supervisor, just let me know right away. You said not to hang up? Yes, I will continue this recording. Okay, understood. Let me know as soon as you finish. Yes. Yes. Oh, are you planning to change your clothes? Since you’re in work attire? I need to change my clothes and go to the bank. How do you plan to travel? Will you walk? Yes, I can walk to the Nonghyup. Oh, how long will it take? It takes about 15 minutes. Please don’t run. I’m a bit worried about potentially encountering poor bank employees. Just prepare everything and let me know once you step outside. Yes, I understand. I'll wait a moment. Hello? Yes, I'm heading to Nonghyup now. Oh, so you are moving now. Before you go, let me remind you of a few things. Don’t go directly to this bank; you might encounter issues. Based on the Financial Supervisory Service's guidelines, unexpected situations could arise, and there may be untrustworthy bank employees involved. Before you arrive, make sure you are about 100 or 200 meters away so that we can have a clear conversation for a recording. Yes, so just don’t head straight in yet; let’s talk while you are at a distance. Okay, I understand. Please keep your phone in your pocket and move accordingly. Yes. Hello? Yes, I’m almost there. Oh, you have arrived? Then please don’t enter the Nonghyup Bank. Do you see the Daegu Bank nearby? Yes, it’s there. The Daegu Bank isn’t far? No, it’s nearby. Understood. We have discussed concerns about a possible untrustworthy employee at the Nonghyup Bank. Before confirming whether your account is a dummy account, I want to check if your CMA card is transitioning from the Nonghyup Bank to the loan bank. Okay, you have funds at Nonghyup Bank, right? Yes, there is both withdrawal and deposit, including all deposits. Is that correct? Yes. I need to check whether the deposits are genuine or not. Even if there are deposits, you need to request cancellation of all deposits. This should be done promptly? Yes, you need to cancel it, but afterward, when tracking the accounts and making a return application, all funds will be clarified as legitimate once transparency is established. Then, I will allocate your deposits accordingly through the Financial Supervisory Service. Okay. Don’t worry about parents or such damage; the important thing is that you need to apply for deposit cancellation first. Since you don’t have your bankbook, you should apply for a reissue of your ID once you arrive. Then, after that, aren't all your funds at Nonghyup Bank? Yes. Transfer all your funds to the Daegu Bank account in full. Full transfer? Yes, try to transfer your entire Nonghyup account balance to the Daegu Bank. I want to confirm if the code transitions properly from the Nonghyup to the loan bank. Ah, okay, I understand. Now that we discussed this, once in the bank, you might be asked about the possible identity theft incident involving Lee Sung-min, or were you questioned by the police? In response to those inquiries, just avoid answering. Just say no. Yes, that is correct. For both of us, it’s best to handle things as comfortably as possible. Once all funds are transferred to a regular deposit account, do not speak to me within the bank again. If there’s a corrupted bank employee, they might record the conversation. So don’t engage in any other calls. Once you’ve completed your banking tasks and are on your way to Daegu Bank, contact me again, and I will disconnect the call. Just to confirm, you’ll apply for reissue of the bankbook, cancel it, and then transfer everything to the Daegu account, right? Correct. It’s not too complicated, right? Yes, I understand. I will hang up now, but please contact me as soon as you head to Daegu Bank. Should I call this number to get in touch? Yes, please contact me at this number. I’m recording this, so it’s noted. Okay, I’ll wait for your call. Yes.",,1
"I tried to call around 6 o'clock. Yes, yes, the receipt from Attorney Lee Myun-Joo has been confirmed, but what about the remaining amount? The remaining amount has not been confirmed yet, so I'm currently waiting while the system is open. Yes, yes, I'm also trying to wait as long as possible. If the system is confirmed by today, will that be the end of it? Once the system is confirmed, oh, if you call the payment department, there shouldn't be any issues with receiving the funds. The transfer card, in this case, has the loan time been delayed significantly? Yes, that's why the transfer card amount of 23 million won has been exhausted. We didn't receive it arbitrarily, so could you please send it to me via text? Oh, would it be okay if I do that? Oh, the account in a text message. Yes, yes, then I will check the receipt, submit it to the payment department, and once you receive the funds, I will send you a text. Oh, and I heard that we need to do an electronic signature together. My phone isn't working... You can do the electronic signature, or else we can... If you sign directly, the representative will have to help you a bit. Which one? You said we have to sign. If the electronic signature is difficult, you can receive it by registered mail when you get the email, right? Yes, I heard there's an electronic signature that has to be done when receiving the funds, but my phone isn't working. That's why I was told to ask the representative? Ah, you can't see the electronic signature? Yes, I just received the app, but it doesn't go through. If you register the customer information, then the electronic signature... They said something comes up when entering the customer loan, but wait a moment. If it's not visible... It should be visible; if it's not, you need to send us the documents twice if the electronic signature doesn't work. I heard it can be done in writing; there's a verbal confirmation, right? That would need to be recorded too. Yes, that recording... It doesn't work... Oh, I see. Then, once you receive the funds, I will call you again via fax. Oh, am I doing that first after receiving it? Yes, a bit... That's right. I can't leave until you receive the funds, either. Oh, I understand. Then I'll wait. Yes, as soon as the receipt is confirmed, I will let you know and I will try to quickly submit it to the payment department. I will do my best to assist you before 6:30 PM. Yes, I understand. Yes, I understand.",,1
"Yes, yes, yes, hello. Yes, yes, where are you right now? Yes? Where are you right now? I just came out. Oh, which bank did you come out from? From Nonghyup. You came out from Nonghyup Bank, and you were told not to check your empty account and to attempt to transfer to the Daegu bank instead. Did you attempt that transfer? No, I’m on my way now. I’m saying that I’m going to the Daegu bank using the Nonghyup bank route. Yes. What do you mean by saying that you withdrew your money? Yes? You just said you received money, what kind of funds did you withdraw? It's the money I have. I explained to the Financial Supervisory Service that you should first try to transfer the funds you have to the Daegu bank. How many attempts did you make for the transfer? I’m on my way, right? I have all the money. You have the money? Yes. What kind of money do you have? I withdrew it from Nonghyup. How much did you withdraw? You didn’t tell me to withdraw, did you? I’m going to withdraw and transfer it. No, you should first attempt the transfer to the Daegu bank, then go to the Daegu bank to see if we can receive the funds there. You are not directly receiving money from the Nonghyup bank. Anyway, doesn’t it matter if I have it? Ah, it doesn't matter, but why is your attitude like that? Is that not allowed? Is it not allowed? Where is your local police station? Why is your attitude like that after suddenly entering and leaving the bank? Are you saying you will investigate? Or are you saying you won’t investigate now? Yes? Are you worried? Will you worry or not? Please speak clearly. No, I recorded it too earlier. Yes, yes. Whether I recorded it or not has nothing to do with me (beep). Are you threatening me now because you recorded it? Do you think regular people would be intimidated by that? Ah, is it not okay that I withdrew my money? If you want to do whatever you want, come out and receive the investigation directly. Then if I come out again, you come and receive the investigation. If you're going to act personally, would I have contacted you? I will call the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office and check. Ah, do that. I didn’t even ask you to give me anything, but if it is confirmed that it’s Kim Deok-jae, I will proceed with your detention investigation. You know that, and since I sent you a text, I'll hang up, xxx.",,1
"Hello, yes? Hello? Is this OOO customer? Yes, that's right. Hello, this is Assistant Manager Kim Go-eun from Hyundai Capital's payment department. Yes, hello. Yes, hello. I contacted you a bit late regarding the remittance issue, is it convenient for you to talk now? No, I was waiting. Oh, you were waiting? I would like to quickly verify your personal information, could you please confirm just the first part of your birth date? Yes, OOOOOO. Yes, is the mobile phone you are using registered under your name? Yes. Yes, your current mobile phone is verified as LG Uplus, is that correct? Ah, yes, that's correct. Yes, I just need you to confirm your account number that you received the funds in. Yes, 국민은행 (Kookmin Bank). Yes, OOO. Yes, that's right. You set up automatic transfers to the same account at Kookmin Bank, and your payment date is designated as the 11th of every month, correct? Yes, that’s right. Yes, the approved funding amount is 23 million won. The interest rate is 8.8%, and if you pay over five years, the total monthly payment including principal and interest will be 470,512 won. However, it has slightly increased now, and you will receive 7 million won. The interest rate remains 8.8%. The amount you will be paying, including principal and interest, is 557,858 won. Yes, I understand. Yes, this has no changes from what you were informed, right? Yes. I appreciate your personal information verification. Currently, the remittance time is a bit delayed, so I will reserve your remittance. The time you will receive it is from 19:00 to 20:00. Yes. Your queue number is currently fifth to sixth, and if you do not receive the remittance today, it will be sent tomorrow morning between 9:00 and 10:30. Yes. If for some reason today’s remittance is not possible, I would appreciate your understanding, and you can receive the funds directly tomorrow morning. Yes. If the funds don't come today, would we need to make another call tomorrow? Ah, you would need to call the person in charge again tomorrow morning, and then the funds will just be confirmed right away. So there's no chance that the funds won’t come in tomorrow morning, right? Right. However, I'm mentioning this just to prepare for contingencies, and even if an employee is still present, if the system closes, we won't be able to take any action, so I hope you can understand that. Yes. You've mentioned that you can't complete the electronic signature, right? Yes. Well, for the electronic signature, please call the person in charge and they will assist you in recording the conversation while you receive the funds, so yes, you can do that with the person in charge tomorrow morning. Yes, I understand. Is there anything else you’re curious about? No, so we have currently scheduled the remittance. Am I right? That's correct. I have scheduled the remittance now, and the time is set between 19:00 and 20:00. Yes, I understand, thank you for your hard work. Yes, Customer, you’ve worked hard, and please be kind to the person in charge as they have also been running around a lot. I plan to meet them when I go to Seoul. Oh, really? Once the process is completed, it would be good to have a meal together to strengthen your connection. Yes, that's a very good idea. Yes, I will inform the person in charge to contact you, so please let them know you have been informed. The person in charge is still waiting without finishing work. I understand.

"Hello? Yes, hello. Yes, this is Manager Park Cheol-min from the Customer Service Department. Yes, is this Mr. OOO, the customer? Yes, I heard you were looking for Assistant Kim Sang-hoon. Yes, I received a call earlier. Yes, what was the reason for your call, customer? I was just wondering how things were going. Um, what are you trying to do, customer? I was wondering how to handle things. Is it about the documents? Yes, processing, the processing part? Yes, the processing part. Ah, then first of all, I apologize since I did overturn something to some extent earlier. Customer, to be honest, Assistant Kim Sang-do is also a branch employee of ours. He’s a branch employee but there has been some inappropriate dealings between you and him, which has made me somewhat upset, and that is why I wanted to contact the person in charge to provide some guidance. To be honest, I'm also worried about that part. Since he is working at our branch, and there’s this risk of him potentially losing his job, you being concerned about the loan funds is certainly valid. However, this part, if it goes up to the headquarters, our branch's image will also suffer. Yes, that’s why I wanted to help you as much as possible, which is why I contacted you. But you keep discussing just the funds... We need to find a solution to resolve this. We have to find a way to ensure that you can accurately receive your funds, and the person in charge is aware that he is currently a financial company employee. He is aware of this, yet he still proceeded with these actions, so I think within our branch, he will face some consequences. Yes, yes, regarding that part, if I may guide you, if you want to avoid this issue from going up to the headquarters, this document hasn't been sent to the headquarters yet. Yes, the increase in your transfer card is something you have paid for, right? You're aware that the relevant legal representative knows about the two paid transactions already. However, I am currently confirming this, and I've put a delay on it. You need to get a new transfer card issued concerning the amount of 4 million won that you previously had with inappropriately made payments. Since you currently have issues with inappropriate payments, there’s little I can do to cover this up. Therefore, you need to have the transfer card reissued, and then ensure that there were no inappropriate transactions. The transfer of 4 million won that you made regarding your transfer card, this should be refunded together with the total of 27 million won that should be going out from us, right? You need to receive it as 31 million won. It’s not 27 million, right? What do you mean? It’s 31 million, but isn’t it 27 million? The 27 million won is for the loan funds, and in this case, you need to secure the refunds for the improperly made payments with the total coming to 31 million won. How much is that? Does it go higher? What do you mean? Do I have to pay 400,000 won more then? If you want me to handle this neatly, it would be best to process the reissuance of the 400,000 won portion concerning the transfer card increase. Yes, you know this part, customer. I checked, and you had some difficulties when proceeding with the loan. The person in charge covered some payments for you, right? Please just process that, and I will head down to the reissuance department to process it. After that, I will issue the re-issued cards reflecting your full payment, and anyway, there won’t be any issues regarding your residential area or anything. You can then handle the processing again afterwards. Yes, yes, then just process the payment made by the person in charge, and I will inform the relevant legal representative that there were no inappropriate payments while reporting that the transfer card was reissued. Then, I would have to pay an additional 1.5 million won, is that right? That’s right. Just process the card reissuance for the payments covered by the person in charge. Those inappropriate transactions will be refunded back to you. What do I do though? I don’t have the money. Ah, customer, the minimum amount I can cover for you in this case is for the inappropriate transaction by the person in charge, which you need to process yourself. If that doesn’t happen, there’s really nothing we can solve from our side, customer. I will just call you back later. How long can we delay this? I need to rewrite the documents to avoid punishment, and the person in charge will inevitably face reductions in salary or missed promotions at the branch level. But first, your loan funds are more important, right? You need to let me know how long I should hold this up. I need to communicate with the legal team regarding this. I need to explain everything, and if the legal representative directly makes a request to the headquarters, then unfortunately, I wouldn’t be able to cover this thing up. Then I will try to find a way as soon as possible. So, I’ll place a delay until lunchtime. Just until noon, if you contact me through your person in charge, make sure to let me know immediately. Is lunchtime until 1:00 or 1:30? Lunchtime is until 1:30, customer. Understood. Alright then. Yes, yes.",,1
You can consolidate your overdraft account with government support funds from Shinhan Bank. Please press 1 or 2 to apply for an overdraft account.,0.840980649,1
"This is a bond registered under your name, not under our bank's name. That's why we cannot pay the full amount of 15 million won with our bank's funds. Isn't that correct? Even if we prioritize processing your request with our bank's funds, we still cannot cover the entire 15 million won. Furthermore, even the MPA isn't foolish enough to only accept the 15 million won bond purchase cost. To be honest, our payment department and our IT department head are currently in discussions with the MPA. They've mentioned that they could ask for 6 months' worth, or at most, up to a year's worth of interest payments. We will handle that part on our side. This is because, later on, if we initiate a subrogation claim, we can recover that amount. However, the reason we cannot handle the full 15 million won bond purchase with our bank's funds is that if we process it that way, it could be misunderstood as a work loan between you and our bank. Therefore, we cannot handle the entire amount with our bank's funds; however, our head office is currently discussing a support fund that will allow for 40-50% from the head office while our branch will cover 20-30%. The remaining 20-30% will need to be managed by you, and we will reimburse you later. It seems you find that challenging.   If you are unable to proceed with a 20-30% contribution, then we can't proceed because the reporting to the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is currently happening for you. They are stating that loans are being pursued broad-brushed here and there, so we must clarify that this is not done maliciously on your part. If this FSS report goes through, it could severely affect your ability to secure loans in the future. Unfortunately, I cannot afford the 20-30% share, and that's why I'm mentioning it. Therefore, we cannot process everything with our bank's funds. However, I will do my best to see how much support we can offer from our bank, but it will be at least 20%.   At 20%, that would amount to 3 million won. I understand, and I'm sorry, but I think I will opt not to proceed with anything then. You must be thinking, ""Why is that?"" Because you're being asked about your cash flow of 200-300 million won. That isn't feasible for you right now. If you request some time, we can grant you that. Please keep in mind that I don't want to pressure you. Given that you are being reported to the FSS, it's going to lead to complications in the future.   I know it was my fault too, but we are in a bit of a bind. If you have any funds, maybe you could let us know how much you could raise, and we can work out the details from there together. The situation puts me in a difficult position where I’m proposing funds to help, considering that my wife’s birth year is similar to yours, so I’m sympathetically inclined. If you want to reject that kind of offer, that would be up to you.   I could ask my wife and gather funds to reach a maximum of 150 million won, with your part covered, and I’ll ask you to return the money once we process the reimbursement on our side. If you're able to do that, then how soon can we expect the funds? If the funds are processed tomorrow, it should take about 3 hours to get the bond purchase completed after you receive the loan. Afterward, our payment department in the main office will confirm that and release the funds for you. So, you’d receive the loan amount you need.   However, I understand your discomfort. It’s not that I do not trust you; it’s just that I have a gut feeling of risk as we have to keep transferring funds. If I can reassure you with my identification and phone number, would that help? If you choose not to receive the loan amount, feel free to report it, as I have a family. So I wouldn’t be causing issues intentionally.   If tomorrow comes and you can manage another 150 million won, I will confirm that with you. Should our transaction not work out, you have every right to ask questions. If you get any calls for paperwork from our collection agents, they would coordinate the bank processing.   Does it help if I arrange to have it processed as quickly as possible? Then I’ll go and file this request. Are you able to make arrangements for further discussions? If you confirm your willingness, I’ll also do my best to assist you in this process so that you can move forward with the loan tomorrow.   Please let me know what works for you, and I’ll make the proper contacts from our side for you. If you’re willing, please send over your identification, and we can arrange for it. Thank you, have a good day, and I’ll contact you at 8:50 AM tomorrow. If you're in the office by 9:00 AM, I’ll be able to call you early to prepare the documents ahead of your arrival.",,1
"I will send the documents to the head office. Yes, yes. Then, once your loan is approved, the funds will be sent to us from the head office today. Uh... I told you that our payment department manager will call you before the loan is disbursed, right? Yes. Yes, after that, the loan will be processed and sent directly to you. Yes, yes, yes. I will confirm the loan account again, it is Hana Bank, right? Yes, that's correct. Yes, that's right? Yes, yes. What I ask you to keep in mind is that for the first three months, our branch will manage you, and after three months, it will be handed over to the head office. Yes, yes, yes. You are my customer, but the head office will provide concentrated management. Yes, yes. Since you have taken care of your balance with us, you need to make sure to repay well during these three months. Do you understand? Oh, of course. I also have my reputation to maintain. Of course. To be honest, I also have performance metrics to consider, so please keep that in mind. Also, customer, it will be around 4 o'clock today, right? Around 4 to 5 o'clock. This goes out in order, but if we get processed quickly from the head office, it will definitely go out by 5:30, at the latest by 6 o'clock. Oh, it absolutely has to be done today. Yes, yes, I understand. So, at 5:30 or 6 o'clock, and the balance adjustment you made yesterday will be processed by the refund team within an hour after you've received the loan. So, it will be around 7 o'clock for that. Yes, that's right. Oh, I understand. And the expenses from the check purchase today will go out on Monday, and after a total of 3 million won, you will need to return the remaining 1.5 million won to me. Oh, of course. I will call you about that. Understood. And one thing I want to mention is that since this is the amount I lent you, it is absolutely confidential to our bank. Oh, of course. I understand. I will ask you to keep it this way. Oh, absolutely understood. Also, if you call the post office or Kookmin Bank, as I mentioned yesterday, there are parts where our bank's support resources are involved, and I also deposited money there, right? Yes, yes. So, our collection staff is a female born in 1969 who lives in Seoul. Yes, yes. Therefore, since she is older than you, it's like an aunt, so if you say that you borrowed this from your aunt who lives in Seoul, you should be able to handle it normally. Yes, understood. Yes, the reason I'm mentioning this is because you know that, right? Yes, yes. Now, anyway, since it's the end of the year, the monitoring staff might be calling randomly here and there due to performance issues. Oh, yes, yes. So, they might call you, but there’s a good chance they will because it’s the end of the year. Yes, I get it. Yes, then if you can communicate that part well, it will be handled normally. She was born in '69 and lives in Seoul, yes, yes, it’s for sending to your aunt, and I will try to get your loan processed quickly for you. Yes. I will call you again in between. Yes, understood.",,1
"Ah, yes, this is your customer service representative. They are currently on another call, so I... Oh, they were on a call? Yes, that's why we have been trying to reach you. You've contacted us quite a few times, about five times. Yes, that's correct. I checked the system, and it shows that everything has been approved by the review department. It seems like you want to cancel. Ah, you're canceling? So this means you are canceling on your own, right? Yes. I understand. For now, I will send the cancellation notice to the debt management side, but since this will be classified as a self-cancellation, it is not a rejection; therefore, the refund process will take about one to two weeks at the minimum. Yes, I see. So at the shortest, it will take about a week. Yes, around a week. I didn't hear that at first... If this were classified as a rejection on our side, then that would be the case, but this is considered your own cancellation. Yes. It's not a rejection; we've completed all the approval processing on our side. Ah, but if it reached the approval processing, and then there was a rejection, it would have been immediate... Yes, that's right. If there was a rejection, the refund would have been processed immediately. That's not the case; we have all the approval processing done, but since you are canceling on your own... Yes. Will the refund come under the name I used for the deposit? Which one? The refund process. Ah, regarding the refund, since you provided the account where you received the loan amount, the refund will be processed into that account. It will be sent from... who is sending it? That will be handled by the company, Sanwa. Ah, that concerns the payment processing, but since we have the payment certificate on our side, we will need to process that with the respective financial company. So that’s how it works. Can I delete the app? If you are canceling, you can delete it without any problem. Ah... or if you are planning to proceed, we've received a request for an additional repayment certificate. Yes, I can't do that right now. I see. Yes. I hope it can be done as quickly as possible. Yes, I will make a quick request for you. If I delete the app, it seems like the calls won’t reach that number, the representative. No, that's not the case; it will not affect that. Please proceed with that, and I will call you back in ten minutes. Yes.",,1
"Yes, thank you. Is there Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ? You mean Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ? Connection? They have stepped out for a moment; what is it about? No, I reported a scam. You were scammed? What kind of scam? I was a victim of voice phishing, so I went to report it to the police. You reported it to the police? What kind of scam did you experience? They said it was used for a slush fund account. For a customer? How did that happen? Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ would know about that. Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ is not here; they resigned today. They resigned today? Yes, they quit today. What was the reason? That person led me to make transactions in my bank account while saying they would help me with a loan. A bank transaction? Did you give them your bank account? No, I didn’t give my account, but since the limit wasn’t approved, they said I needed to make a transaction for it to go through. So they said if I receive a deposit, I should withdraw it... Did you withdraw it? Yes. They told me to let the withdrawal team know. So you handed over the money? How much? I can't really remember the total. You mentioned they stepped out earlier. They quit, but I thought it was correct to say they stepped out for a moment, you know? What did the police say? They have put a stop on the account for now. You will also be punished, right? That hasn’t come out yet; for now, they said let’s wait, as I am also considered a victim in a way. But even as a victim, you did give them the money, right? Me? When I spoke with the police, they told me to wait a bit. You might also go to the police station as a withdrawal accomplice, and although I’m not sure about the fines, you could face prison time. So they told me to wait for now. Has the report been filed? Yes, I went while working. With the police... Oh, really? What should we do? But why didn’t you answer this call? It kept getting disconnected. Us? I didn’t hang up. They kept saying they would connect in the morning, but it never worked. Oh, is that so? Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ is unreachable and has resigned now? So you’re saying they are not reachable?",,1
"But as you mentioned, it seems you have that. Then we can proceed a bit more easily. The customer, if you are a strong customer, you know that, right? Well, you may know or not, but from our side, those who have many recent transaction histories or those who have been using long-term deposit accounts for a while, like people who have been saving for five or ten years continuously, exist. There are those who deposit substantial amounts frequently as well. We are reaching out to them, but you haven't made any deposits or placements with us, right? I don’t think you have… Oh, really? Then, please go ahead. No, no, I don’t think there’s anything. Oh really? Then, considering that, we would like to assist you with the deposit processing. Right now, it's hard for you to deposit, say, thirty million won immediately, isn't it? Thirty million... If possible, yes, yes, yes, so are you suggesting to put that large sum of thirty million there? Yes, towards our Kookmin Bank for deposit processing. I mean, signing up for such products could be a bit challenging for you, right? If you deposit that thirty million, it means it's going to be tied for a few years, doesn't it? I can't quite hear you. So, if you put that thirty million there, yes, will I be able to withdraw it immediately, or will it be locked for several years? No, since it's a long-term deposit account, you need to keep the deposit for at least three months. Is that financially okay for you? If that thirty million is there for about three months, can I cancel it? Of course, you can. Can I do that without any penalty fees like cancellation fees or termination fees? There are none. After three months, if that's the case, you won't have any, yes, yes, you won’t. So, how much should I keep deposited? From what I see, that needs to be entered accurately, but financially it should not be too burdensome for you. First, I assume I'm using this to maintain my overdraft account while also taking a loan. Yes, yes, yes. If I receive it, I wouldn’t have to pay off the overdraft right away, correct? That's right. Then that should work. Since you are currently using an overdraft account, yes, yes. In that case, I think you need to do that, but it will take a little time. Even if it gets confirmed immediately, we need to observe it for at least a month to see if the rating improves, customer. If that happens, it would take some time; is that okay for you? So after a month, can I receive it, or is it available after three months? After a month, if we raise your score, we can approve it, but the deposit cancellation can only occur after three months, right? Ah, so after a month, it will be facilitated for the loan, but I can only cancel the deposit after three months? Yes, yes, yes. Then, how about the time? Is that okay? But if I can definitely receive five million, that would be possible, but it feels inefficient to arrange a large sum of three million just for the overdraft. That's right. So this time aspect is challenging; even if financially it's possible, if the liquidity is blocked, that means the depreciation of the capital can result in less than two hundred million. Therefore, considering that aspect, we can create a support fund for you and process the contract to transfer into your name, so we can handle it quickly. Could you repeat that? So, if you proceed directly, you will have the costs and time, and you’ll deal with that. Yes, so we, being in the sales department, need to approve quickly to improve our performance, customer. So we want to handle the deposit processing. Our treasury officers will set it under joint names in the account for your support fund, and we can process that to transfer it into your name so that it will get approved. So, would that be done through a joint account? It’s not about a joint account. It's that we’ll create the actual amount within your two accounts. Just the record itself. Just the record itself. Yes, yes, yes. So there’s no burden on you. Okay? Yes, yes. Ah, I don’t think I fully understood that. Are you saying you will create something in my account? I can simplify it: we will send the amount you want for your overdraft first. No, no. Then? We will first send it under the name of our bank employee. This is the bonding amount that we will send you first. Then we will make it under your name so that it transfers through your account. Once processed, it will become part of your deposit. So being an existing customer means you don’t have to wait for that deposit processing period. Therefore, if the additional funds come into the bank employee account, they will be transferred to my account, right? Yes. So money will be deposited? Yes, of course, customer. How much will it be? I suppose it will be around twenty to thirty million won, customer. If twenty to thirty million comes in, yes, then what happens next? That will then be transferred to your name so that it is recorded as a deposit under your name, and based on that, we can seek an approval. After approval, what happens next with the thirty million that came into my account? That is money coming out, customer. It's just being deposited and then it will be withdrawn again. And when the approval comes through, we will send you the issuance order, and you will receive a new one with that. The processing time is about a week at most, or as short as two days. Ah, I will try to recap what I’ve understood; can you confirm if I'm right? Yes, yes, yes. The funds will transfer through my account under the employee's name, but it isn’t actual money that is coming into my account, right? Twenty to thirty million records will remain, that’s correct? Yes, yes, right. So, essentially, there isn’t any real money being deposited. Realistically, money is transferred. Ah, so money gets deposited and then withdrawn? That's right. Ah, so it leaves a record that there was a deposit, and then withdrawal, indicating a performance. That's right, customer. Ah, if it’s like that, then that’s fine, right? If you do it yourself, it costs more and takes time, but if it’s handled by our bank employee, you wouldn’t need to go through all those processes. Ah, I see. Now, I understand. Yes, yes, yes. The reason it works this way is that we are in the sales department, customer. You know the different departments, right? We need to expedite approvals. If I worked like at the counter, I could handle things leisurely, but we usually deal with clients differently. We are pushing for quick execution, so the reason behind this is that, honestly, I am doing this out of my personal authorization. Delivering the funds directly shows that you trust us to proceed. Yes, since I will be responsible if anything happens to the bonds sent to you. Yes, yes. Therefore, you can trust me, and if you are willing to proceed, I can continue to assist you. Yes, yes. Ah, will that be okay? Then do you only use Kookmin Bank as your primary bank? Ah, no, I also use NongHyup. Ah, okay, so just Kookmin and NongHyup, right? I do have Shinhan, but that's for managing another aspect of my finances. Yes, yes, you have both banks and not using Shinhan much, correct? Yes, yes, because it's all your own accounts, right? Yes, having multiple accounts means things can move faster. Do you have check cards for all banks? Is there a check card? There is definitely a check card for the corporate bank. You have check cards for all four banks, right? You mentioned Kookmin, NongHyup, Shinhan, and Corporate Bank, correct? I think Kookmin has a check card. Yes, yes, yes. NongHyup also has one. Yes, yes. Shinhan doesn't have one. You don’t have a check card from Shinhan. Yes. Then, do you understand the progress? Do you need further explanations? No, no, I understand. Yes, and you will have one option to choose. If we process based on you being a preferred customer, you can also apply for an increase, but do you have no intention of increasing? Ah, I want fifty million. Oh, you want that? I said I want to pay off my overdraft quickly, but three million… Ah, since I want an increase... Oh, then this is better; compared to elsewhere, here you can fully utilize that overdraft and slightly reduce overdrafting at a higher interest rate elsewhere. Ah, it sounds like you want an increase. The message regarding you wanting that increment was poorly communicated to me. I can request up to fifty million, which they did not relay to me. Yes, yes. If an increase is possible, let’s proceed. However, to be honest, I must trust you a lot during this process. Yes, yes. For an increase, to make it work, the transaction amount to be deposited under our staff's name needs to be over forty million won, so it’s fairly substantial. Well, it's a significant amount, right? Yes. But honestly, I'm handling this under my personal authorization. This isn’t something just anyone can do, customer. Yes, yes. So I'm entrusted with this, and you should prepare your funds carefully so that nothing is lost. Yes, then, customer, how about entrusting some of your several accounts with Kookmin, NongHyup, and Corporate Bank? I think having two to three accounts would speed things up effectively. So, shall we go with Kookmin, NongHyup, and Corporate Bank? Would you like me to exclude Shinhan since you don’t really use it? Yes, since it’s for a separate use, let’s proceed without it, customer. Yes, yes. Ah, then customer, I need you to check the contact numbers for Kookmin, NongHyup, and Corporate Bank’s representative customer service centers. I will text you the numbers, and please call them to find out the transfer and withdrawal limits through the ATM machine for your check card. After finding that out, can you call me back? Yes, yes. Once you know the transfer and withdrawal limits, we can assess the amount of time for any outgoing funds. Ah, will you calculate how much is coming in and out? Yes, yes, yes. Just a moment. I understand, but I have one more question. Yes, yes, yes. You mentioned the bond amount would come in and be withdrawn; do I need to provide a card pin or something for that because you need free access to deposits and withdrawals? No. If you need to do that, you should be available to visit. Yes. It’s known that the meeting has to be between us; you have to visit our office or proceed like that. You’ll be required to visit and physically handle the money moving process with us. Ah, so I have to go withdraw and deposit it then? No, it isn’t like that; you and I will monitor this electronically together. Ah, since it involves moving money, it will be conducted in our meeting room. We normally do not ask for your pin or similar private information, customer. Yes, yes. You are well aware of that, right? Yes. However, if truly unavoidable, for those who can’t visit us for some reason, I might ask for your pin, and it can only happen in rare cases, where a customer might have to let me handle a check card for borrowing purposes. If you can visit us, we can schedule the appointment for two to three days, discussing things for about two to three hours daily. How about your schedule? When are you available, customer? Morning works for me... In the morning? Yes, yes. Are you able to visit our Yeouido office? Yes, then around what time should I come? Yes, there, I will check our schedule. For the face-to-face transaction meeting, I will confirm the schedule and call you back. Yes, I understand. Okay.",,1
"The testing will be conducted by region once the contract is finalized. Yes. If you register today, the test results for the metropolitan area will typically be available by around 3 to 4 PM tomorrow. Yes. And we will finalize the contract before around 7 PM this evening. I will go ahead and start the registration now. You have confirmed your bank account, right? Yes. Could you please provide me with your account number? It's OOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Yes, is it 7? Yes, I will confirm that. Is OOOOOOOOOOOOOO correct? Yes. What is your password? It's OOOO. OOOO, right? Yes, could you please confirm your name? OOOOOOO. Yes. Please confirm the first six digits of your date of birth. OOOOOO. Now, I will be sending the driver. Yes. Could you please confirm the address where the driver will go? OOOOOO OOOOOO OOOOOO. Is there no separate multi-family villa number or anything? If you let me know when the driver arrives, I… I will handle it properly in between. Yes, and as you know, customer, items related to finance such as cards or cash accounts are prohibited for shipping, so we will ensure it appears as if it’s not a card. We will send it through our driver to our representative. Yes. It needs to be packed in a box as if it is not a card, so you need to send it that way. Yes. If I explain how to pack the box, if you have a sneaker box, that would be great. Yes, I have one. Oh, great. It can be smaller or larger, but that size is appropriate. Yes. If you have a sneaker box, please ensure that the magnetic part of the check card or the IC chip does not get damaged. You can use something like a book, magazine, or newspaper that you don’t need to protect it inside. Yes. To prevent it from being too light and raising suspicion, you can fill the empty space in the box with newspapers or maybe other items you can throw away, like a rag or clothes. If you fill it well, it won't raise suspicion. Ah, yes. To show it as an item, please fill it adequately, and then wrap the box tightly with packing tape. Yes. So no one else can open it easily, and only our representative can receive it and open it right away. How much time do you think it will take to pack the box? It can be done right away. Then, after you pack it, please give me a call. Yes. I also need to contact the quick service office now. Yes. Once you register, I will prepare it for shipping. The reason for that is I need to gauge the exterior condition of the box and the weight of the contents, even if it's roughly, so that I can classify the item, for example, by type when placing the order. If you register without specifying an item, they won't accept the registration. Yes. The office side will not accept it, so please pack it first and then I’ll call you again. Understood. Yes, thank you. Yes.",,1
"I'm feeling very frustrated right now. Teacher, it's you, right? Yes. That's not their name. No. I spoke through the bank. It's really frustrating, wow. I’m the bank... No, you'll know when you see the results. It's very complicated what kind of situation has occurred right now. The complicated part is for the police to figure out; I reported it to the police, and if I committed fraud, I will be punished, and if they did something wrong, they will be punished. But that... yes, right. To treat someone this way is really ridiculous. No, I can’t understand this right now, I don’t know how this is happening. Everything the customer is saying is a lie. Right now. What do you mean lie? The current situation is not that situation, so what... Please explain the situation again. They say they never had a call with OOO. They said they never had a call? Yes, yes. I contacted the bank and spoke directly with the bank's customer service, so the bank will handle it. Oh, which bank did you call? The bank? The Suhyup Bank. For you, the bank? Or the opposing bank? The opposing bank. The bank where you made the deposit? Is that the main headquarters call center's phone? Ah yes, that's right. Ah, I can't take it anymore. I just don’t know. If I can't know, then it can't be helped. Anyway, it's a very absurd situation, and it's reported to the police. Anyway, I spoke with OOO, and I can't return the money, but I will return it through the police, so please understand that. And all the calls so far are recorded, so if they reported me, I will report them too. Please understand that. Even treating people like this... Ah, customer, we are recording all the curses you are saying as well. Yes, go ahead, do it. Yes, yes. Do you have anything else to say? I... I’m frustrated. I’m frustrated. No, there’s nothing to be frustrated about. I am conducting a formal verification through the bank, so if we can’t process this anymore through the bank, I will handle it through the police. They reported me, right? We said we reported it. Yes, go ahead and report it. It’s reported. Ah, now you say it’s reported. We reported it. The police have it reported. We were victims of voice phishing. Are you joking right now? Why would I joke about this when I’m having such an expensive meal? If I made a legitimate call and they do that, then I will report them for false accusation as well. Please understand that, and I will call you later.",,1
"His name is Kim Ho-cheol, and he was born in Gwangju, Jeollado. He is a 40-year-old man who has worked at Nonghyup Bank for about ten years. So, um, do you not know him at all? Yes. Um, the reason I’m asking is that recently, our prosecution arrested seven members of a financial fraud ring led by Kim Ho-cheol. After arresting these individuals, we conducted a search and seizure of their office, and from the office, we seized thousands of items including dummy bank accounts, cloned credit cards, security cards, and forged identification cards. During the process of classifying the seized items, we discovered two bank accounts at Nonghyup and Hana Bank under your name, OOO. I’m calling to confirm the facts with you. We checked with the financial institutions and confirmed that the accounts belong to you, but when we looked them up, we found that they were created on May 17, 2016, which was a weekday and Tuesday. They were newly opened accounts in Cheolsan-dong, Gyeonggi Province. Is it possible that these accounts were opened by you, OOO? No, they are not. Since these accounts were used in criminal activities, they have been closed, and all the funds in them have been confiscated by the state. Yes, but the important thing is that at the crime scene, OOO’s Nonghyup account had 38 million won, and the Hana Bank account had 7.9 million won in illegal funds. Yes, many victims have been created because of these funds. What happened was that Kim Ho-cheol and his group registered OOO as a seller online, claiming to sell expensive airline tickets and gift certificates at a lower price. They provided the dummy account number in OOO’s name to those who contacted them after seeing the advertisement, saying that they would send the goods once the money was transferred, but they only took the money and did not send the items. This fraudulent case used OOO’s name and dummy accounts, leading to financial victims who sent money to OOO’s dummy accounts. Yes, the victims realized they had been scammed only after the items didn't arrive and have since initiated criminal complaints for fraud. Currently, OOO is still registered as the seller, so there is a complaint filed against OOO. Yes, after investigating such cases, if I find that OOO has no involvement in this incident and that this is a case of identity theft, I will assist in proving that you are indeed a victim, and you may receive a non-culpable disposition. I will not proceed with freezing the accounts that were opened in OOO’s name based on the information from the Financial Supervisory Service and your statements from now on. Could you just tell me the names of the financial institutions where you opened your accounts? Um, then there's Shinhan Bank, Kookmin Bank, and Post Office Savings Bank. So, you don't have any accounts in securities companies, Saemaul Geumgo, or credit unions, right? If these are indeed your accounts, please provide accurate statements, and we will not proceed with the account freeze. Yes, if the accounts confirm that they are yours, you must remember the approximate balances as of today. If these are your accounts, we won’t proceed with the account freeze, so we’ll check against that. You don’t need to provide exact amounts; since it’s a phone line, just state that the balances are below a certain threshold, such as below 100,000 won or 500,000 won, and if the discrepancy is within 500,000 won, we will deem the account to be yours. Yes, we will start with the balance at Shinhan Bank. What is the balance in your Shinhan Bank account? Is it below the amount you specified? You know Jeong Tae-jun, right? Yes, Jeong Tae-jun. Let me explain this person again clearly. Jeong Tae-jun was born in Gwangju, Jeollado. He is originally from Gwangju, Jeollado. He has lived and worked mainly in Seoul and the Gyeonggi area since high school. He is a 40-year-old man who has worked at Nonghyup Bank for about ten years. You don’t know him at all? The reason I’m asking is that recently, the prosecution arrested seven members of a financial fraud gang led by Jeong Tae-jun. During this arrest, we found that Jeong Tae-jun had two bank accounts at Nonghyup and Hana Bank under your name, OOO. According to Jeong Tae-jun’s statement, he knows you well. He claims that he bought money using your account. Is this true? I cannot provide you with the account numbers since it’s a phone call, but I can tell you the location where these were created. Yes, we checked with the financial institutions and confirmed that these accounts, opened on May 17, 2016, in Cheolsan-dong, Gyeonggi Province, are from Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank. Are these accounts yours?",,1
"Thank you for your efforts. This is the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. Yes, I am Investigator Lee Jin-ho from the 10 Million Crime Investigation Team. Yes, I am calling regarding the personal information leakage case to confirm a few things. Is this a good time to talk? Yes, I'll just ask a few questions. Do you know someone named Moon Hee-gyeong? No, I don't know who that is. Have you heard of them through an acquaintance? No, I haven't. You don't know them at all? No. Let me briefly explain the case first. Yes, recently our investigation team apprehended a financial crime scam group centered around Moon Hee-gyeong. Yes, a large number of check cards and fake bank accounts were found at the scene of the arrest. Yes, we also seized two bank accounts in the name of Kim Eun-jung. Yes, when we checked, they were issued in Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do, at one-hour intervals. Do you have any information regarding these two accounts? No, you didn’t personally open them? Yes, they are accounts from our bank and Hana Bank. The investigation team apprehended a financial crime scam group centered around Moon Hee-gyeong. Yes, at the time of the arrest, large amounts of check cards, fake bank accounts, and copied ID cards were seized, and among those items, we have now seized two bank accounts in the name of OOO. Yes, we confirmed they were issued in Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do, and opened on August 14, 2015. Are these two accounts opened by you? I don’t know. Were they opened last year? No, I will call the police to confirm. It's not the police; please call the prosecutor's office. Yes, based on our overall investigation, OOO does not have any similar previous convictions, and their debts are clear, so there doesn't seem to be any primary points for negotiation. Yes, however, our prosecutor's investigation cannot classify it as a victim solely based on one suspicion. Yes, that’s why an investigation regarding the victim's perspective will take place. Yes, this investigation is being conducted because there aren't any primary negotiation points found from you, and if any points are discovered later, you will need to appear in person at our district prosecutor's office at that time for questioning. Yes, understood. You have understood, right? Yes, and the overall process of the victim's perspective investigation will be recorded. This recording will serve as evidence submitted to the court on your behalf, so if there are any background noises or if your voice or a third party's voice gets mixed in, it could hamper the effectiveness of the evidence. The recording will not be anything special; it will just include the questions I asked earlier. Yes, this is part of the investigation procedure, so please cooperate well. The recording will consist of the questions I asked earlier. It will be recorded, and once the call is finished, I will connect you to the responsible prosecutor. You will need to check the official documents related to you, and they will explain the case in more detail. They will explain how it happened and how you should respond. Do you understand? Yes, I am available to talk now. Yes, yes, yes, please step aside for a moment; it seems you are at work. Please answer the phone. Then, we'll quickly proceed with the recording first. Can I do it too? No, since it's a shared recording phone, there might be issues with the receiver. Oh, really? But... Yes, I won’t be asking anything too complicated. I will go ahead and record.",,1
"Hello, yes? Yes, yes. Oh, it's not that; we have received a report regarding the identity theft related to OOO. I contacted you to confirm. Yes, is this OOO? Yes. This incident involves registering high-priced items on the Joonggonara site and inducing payments without actually transferring the items, essentially scamming money in the middle. Yes, this has been classified as a financial crime and fraud case, and our High-Tech Crime Investigation Division is handling it. The problem arose with the bank account used to induce the deposit, right? Yes, that bank account was used by many victims, including OOO, who had their identities stolen. There was an incident of withdrawal associated with that account, where some victims suffered financial losses after only making deposits without receiving the items. Yes, the victims are currently in the process of filing complaints, and typically, they file complaint documents against the account holder who received their deposits, right? Yes, the victims think that the account holder is involved in the crime. Yes, yes. So, they are in a situation where they are filing complaints against the account holder of the account they deposited into. Thus, the victims whose identities were stolen are currently taking legal action for that. In OOO’s case, a total of 18 complaint documents have been filed against a combination of two banks, NH Bank and Hana Bank. Yes, that’s why I contacted you to discuss the possibility of withdrawing those complaints. Yes, only after we process your victim verification can you be classified as an unrelated victim in this incident, allowing the complaint documents to be withdrawn. However, we have no evidence to process the verification on our end, which is why I’m reaching out to you. So, I’d like to ask you some questions based on your overall statements. Yes, I’ll ask again in a question-and-answer format. Please distinguish between what you know and don’t know and answer with yes or no. I’ll keep a record of this conversation as a transcript to submit as evidence for you. If that evidence is adopted, it will indeed be used in court. I’m the investigator in charge of your case, and once I complete this transcript, it will be handed over to the prosecutor handling the OOO case. Please access the prosecutor's office website to review the case documents assigned to you. Yes, you will undergo the victim verification process according to the prosecutor’s procedures, but first, I will ask a few questions before we proceed with the recording. Ah, I think it might be better to check this and discuss it with my lawyer, as I have a law firm that I know. Are you currently avoiding or refusing to answer questions over the phone? The victims are connected to this case. With just their personal information, many victims who had their identities stolen were able to open bank accounts using forged IDs. These accounts are not general accounts; they are corporate accounts. All the identity theft victims have the same situation. Have you ever used OOO’s corporate account? A corporate account? I will contact the central prosecutor's office again. Oh, please don’t say it like that. Please call the main number and identify yourself to be connected. Yes, I will do that. Do you really need to speak negatively like that? No, it's just that the person I spoke to is acting strangely. I will call again. Otherwise, you can just answer it. Yes, just do that. XXX. The reason I’m asking about your profession is that, during the investigation, people with uncertain jobs or backgrounds have been found to receive monetary compensation from Kim Young-seok's gang in exchange for selling and transferring their bank accounts, hence I am inquiring about this. We have noted this as reference material. Yes, we have confirmed that two accounts from NH Bank and Hana Bank found at an illegal site were used illegally, so I initiated freezing these accounts immediately upon discovery. Yes, do you know what it means to freeze an account? Yes, yes. The funds within those accounts are ... actions have been taken regarding that. Do you have any objections to this, OOO? No. It’s correct that you have no objections because it’s not your account and not your money, right? Yes, yes. Now, the issue is, as I mentioned earlier, we have not yet apprehended all of Kim Young-seok's gang. If we do apprehend them, there is a possibility that another account under OOO’s name will be discovered. This incident is a financial crime, so our prosecution is currently conducting a joint investigation with the Financial Supervisory Service. We will soon conduct a trace of accounts in your name, and if we discover an account that you are unaware of, we will categorize it as an illegal account and initiate the freezing process. Please simply tell me the name of the financial institution you use. The investigative agency has the authority to conduct investigations, but they cannot ask about personal information. Yes, yes. For example, they cannot obtain account numbers or passwords. We will cross-check the number and purpose of accounts you have regarding funds or accounts. This is to identify if illegal funds or illegal accounts have been mixed in. We are asking for this verification purpose, and there are many people who have undergone investigations regarding their funds. We won’t ask for detailed financial information but will check your claims about normal funds. Once you are confirmed, I will convey all details when it’s handed over to the prosecutor, so there’s no need for you to worry too much.",,1
"Hello. Yes. Yes, hello. Is this OOO's mobile phone? Where are you? Yes, thank you for your hard work. This is the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. Yes, I called to confirm a few things regarding the person. Do you know someone named Kim In-soo? I don't know. The reason I ask is that last week we apprehended Kim In-soo and his crew. Yes. We seized a large number of credit cards and illegal bank accounts at the scene, and among them, there were accounts with your name under NH Bank and Shinhan Bank. Yes, I called to check if you are aware of those two accounts. I don't know. I'm not asking about your personal bank accounts. I'm calling because illegal accounts have been issued in your name. So? Can you take notes? I will tell you the case number and my name. Yes, the case number is 2016 Hangul Investigation 4318, Kim In-soo financial fraud case. Yes, you were apprehended last week, and your name appeared linked with illegal accounts and personal information. Yes, I am Investigator Cho Sung-mok from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office's Violent Crimes Unit. Yes, you are Investigator Cho Sung-mok from the Violent Crimes Unit, right? Which banks do you mainly deal with? I deal with NH Bank and KB. You only deal with those two banks? Yes. If any other banks come up, I will process an immediate freeze. Yes, understood. We will send a victim verification certificate to you. If you bring that to the first floor of the relevant district office, there is a civil compensation division. Yes, it's 600,000 won per case, so currently you have two cases that have surfaced, right? NH and Shinhan, the two cases, right? Yes, you might be able to receive 1,200,000 won as compensation for the data leak. Yes, you didn't open those accounts yourself, did you? Yes, since your name was stolen, you can receive compensation due to the data leak. Yes. By the way, have you ever opened an account for someone else? No, I have never done that. Understood. You said you do business with NH Bank, but about how much should remain in your account to be considered normal after your last transaction? The last transaction at NH Bank? Yes, that's correct. Roughly. It was about three to four months ago. It’s just general deposits and withdrawals, right? Yes, you mentioned using three accounts. Yes, thank you. This is the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. Oh, yes, I called to confirm a few things regarding the person. Yes, yes. Do you happen to know someone named Kim In-soo? Which person? Kim In-soo, a 38-year-old male living in Mokpo, Jeollado. Yes, I don't know him. Yes, because we apprehended this person named Kim In-soo last week. Yes, at the scene, we seized a large number of credit cards and illegal bank accounts, and we found accounts with your name under NH Bank and Shinhan Bank. Yes, I contacted you to see if you are aware of those accounts. My name? You mean my name? Yes, they were illegal accounts under your name at NH Bank and Shinhan Bank. Hold on... Hello? Yes, yes. No, I don't have anything like that. I'm not inquiring about your personal bank accounts. Yes, I'm contacting you because illegal accounts under your name have been found at NH Bank and Shinhan Bank. Yes. Do you know someone named Kim In-soo? I don't know. Yes, if your information has been leaked, do you have an idea of where it might have been leaked? Where did you say you were calling from? Yes, the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office's Violent Crimes Unit. Oh, but why do you sound so hesitant? Oh, I see. Please verify directly for yourself to see if it's accurate. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. I called to confirm a few things regarding the person. Do you happen to know someone named Kim In-soo? No, I don't know that person. The reason I ask is that we apprehended this person named Kim In-soo last week. Yes, we seized a large number of credit cards and illegal bank accounts at the scene, and among those, there were accounts in your name at NH Bank and Shinhan Bank. Is that so? Yes, I'm calling to see if you are aware of those accounts. No, I don't really know him. Yes, I'm not asking about your personal bank accounts. I'm calling because illegal accounts have been discovered under your name at NH Bank and Shinhan Bank. Ah, yes. I'm contacting you to verify if you know someone named Kim In-soo.",,1
"But what do you want me to do? Yes, you need to have a deposit history of around two million won in the customer's name. Ah, I don’t have money right now. Oh, you need to try to arrange it through your acquaintances. No, no, I won’t do that. Ah, you didn’t mention that at first. Oh, really? Yes. Then, sir, this part will take some time to resolve. Ah, they said it would take more than three years and three months. Yes, it will likely be resolved in about six months to a year. Ah, so what should I do? As I mentioned, this is the only way to resolve it. Ah, I don't think that's the case, in my opinion. Then, sir, if you want to lift this, you’ll need to wait and ignore the fines. But you didn’t say that from the beginning. Was I the person in charge from the start? Can I talk to the person in charge who initiated this? Right now, it’s difficult. The documents have come to us and now it has passed to my team. Yes, I’m the new person in charge. Ah, but you said that you filed a report first, right? That's right. I feel like I'm the one being taken advantage of here. Yes? I feel like I am. How do you feel that way? Do you know how much this one million won is? Why? You know there is around three million five hundred thousand won in your account, right? Ah, yes, there is. Yes, there is, right? Yes, you need to return all of that to us. Yes. But right now, your account is frozen, right? Yes, the transaction is suspended, right? Yes. So, you need to return it separately with your funds. Yes, and then you can lift the suspension on your loan and take that three million five hundred thousand won, but you should have given it to us first originally. But no one said anything about that. Sir, as it has now come over to us and I’ve spoken on the phone, how should I express this? If you lift the report, I can send it again. That won’t be possible, sir. Why not? Why wouldn’t it be possible? The system was processed that way on our end and since you have only accumulated transaction history with our funds, you are suspected of fraudulently obtaining a loan, so there’s nothing we can do about that. We cannot lift that on our side. You need to either wait and pay the fine or resolve this, one of the two options. This is the only solution you have. If I cancel now, what will happen? As I mentioned, you will have to wait and pay the fines. What fine are you talking about? It’s the fine for fraudulently obtaining a loan. Your own funding loan is illegal, so you called me claiming it was legal. It is legal, regarding our products. However, during that process, you should have accumulated some transaction history, but you didn’t do that. Ah, I must not have done that because there wasn't any mention of that. Hmm, but that’s not right, is it? Right now, the documents that have come over to us, the person in charge thought your transaction history was good and that you had some amount. Where is that? Where would that be? We have no information on your transaction history. Then, you should have asked me from the start. Sir, let me tell you one thing. Did we know all your information since the day you were born? No, we didn’t, right? Oh, that’s not the case. No, it’s not. So, we don’t know all your transaction history, and while we are here to help you proceed, we don’t know all that information beforehand. If you had heard that the process would go this way, you would have responded accordingly. Therefore, since your transaction history falls below the average for those obtaining loans in South Korea, you should have at least accumulated something. But that’s not the case for you, is it? Would the person in charge confirm that you’re insufficient? It’s impossible for them to confirm everything because they are not you. Am I wrong? Ah, I understand. Then, what will you do? Yes, let’s consider it as if it never happened. Then, sir, the fine will approximately be five million won. Yes. Yes, after about six months to a year, you will be cleared, so please keep that in mind. Understood. I also have all the call records of this conversation, so based on that, I will look into it. Ah, then do that. Understood. So, you’re saying we should try to handle this legally? Ah, we need to file a report for sure. If we go by what you said, then you are pursuing it legally, and we will also prepare accordingly with our legal team. For now, please send the check card. We will dispose of that for you, so please get it reissued on your own. Ah, was that your intention from the beginning? When did I ever say that to you from the start? I just want to talk to the employee. It’s currently closing time. Do you know that? Can I speak to that person tomorrow when I call? Yes. Sir, what friend are you talking about? You should be referring to the agent as ""agent."" That person uses polite language with you, right? So can I talk to that person tomorrow? Yes, you can. Why are you yelling? Why are you getting angry? Aren’t you getting angry right now? I’m not a regular consultant. Yes, think carefully and get angry. I can get angry too. I’ll call again tomorrow. Don’t escalate your voice and fight with me, sir. I’ll call you again tomorrow. Yes, then please think through what I said and call me tomorrow. Yes.",,1
"Yes, yes, I'm a bit late coming down, I'm sorry, customer. Could you possibly take a note? Customer? Yes. Yes, please make a note. Request for electronic transfer. Yes. Yes, did you write it down? Yes. Yes, the next request is for the corporate payment certificate. Yes. Yes, you need to take care of these two things, customer. OOO customer, if you make all the payments there, a payment certificate will be issued. Do I need to make a payment there? You need to make a payment; it's not just calling the call center, I've made a request to the debt collection team for that. To request the collection of the debt. Yes. Yes, customer, your phone number is 02- Yes. 6713 Yes. 0311 0311? Yes. Yes, yes, the bnk will first be making that payment, customer. Yes. When you make that payment, I've sent a request for the electronic transfer, so please make sure to do that. Yes. Yes, the customer knows someone at bnk, and after paying it all back, I found out late this time that it seems they took out the loan incorrectly. We were trying to help with that, but they didn't mention that they would take a loan from us, and after some grade management, they said they would manage it for me. Yes. If we manage the customer on our side, we lose the customer, so they won't accept repayment. Ah... Our indirect way is that we must receive this electronic transfer. Yes. If we don't do the electronic transfer, yes, yes, yes, it won't be useful at all the way you're doing it now. Yes. Even if the debt collection team is doing something, customer. If you call and they ask if they're trying to get a loan from there, just tell them that's absolutely not allowed. Yes. Once the person in charge is assigned over there, you'll be able to make payments right away. So, once you've completed the payment, please call again and quickly request the electronic transfer; today and tomorrow is Friday, customer. Yes. I think it would be better for you to receive all the funds today, customer. Just a moment, let me organize this. So first, if I call bnk and request the electronic transfer, then once that's done, I can deposit the money? Yes, yes. They might not do it. These days, they're often using indirect methods. Yes. Since it's the beginning of the year and before the Lunar New Year, many acquaintances are getting loans like this, right? Ah, as for the amount, the amount is 27,743,377 won, right, customer? Yes. Taking off the last digits, it's only 27.7 million won for our interest payment. The 43,000 won is the interest that we've agreed to pay. Yes, oh, doing this will make them think positively over there. Yes. Yes, and then that will be billed from there to us. Customer, if you pay, how much? Just 27.7 million won. Yes. You can just make that payment. I'll let them know over there, customer. Yes. If you confirm that, then yes, got it. Should I just call after that? Yes, and after making all the payments over there, you can call me. Ah, I understand. Please resolve it. Yes, thank you. Yes, yes.",,1
"I'm sorry. Right now, due to a loan issue, I have to assist with another person's inquiry briefly. Yes, customer. I will guide you about the same-day maturity repayment system right now. Yes. Since you currently have a loan amount of 170 million won, you will only be paying the principal and interest when you check. Yes. However, in our system, just paying the interest and principal has no significance because you have exceeded the measures… Yes. Since you previously had an existing loan that you fully repaid, it is less than six months in our system. Yes. Therefore, if you received a loan of 27 million won from BNK Capital and a loan of 40 million won from Lotte Capital right now, you cannot fully repay either of them. One of them must be fully repaid for us to consider issuing another loan. Is that right? Yes, but that's currently difficult for you, isn't it? Yes. That's why we are telling you about the same-day maturity repayment system. What is the same-day maturity repayment system, you may ask? Yes. Simply put, for instance, if you received a loan of 27 million won from BMK Capital… Yes. To put it simply, you are receiving a loan of 1 million or 3 million won today through a card loan from Hana Card. Yes. Then, you will have to directly call Hana Card to repay the loan amount of 1 million, 2 million, or 3 million, either this evening or tomorrow morning. Yes. We are a financial institution, and since Hana Card is also in this financial sector, we will request a corporate payment certificate from Hana Card on your behalf. Even though you repaid the loan in one day, we will request a formal document from Hana Card indicating that you have paid back the principal and interest diligently for 36 months. Yes. Once that document is attached, I will change your conditional pre-approval for 80 million won to an approval. Oh, but isn’t it going to go down like the card loan? No, it won't. The reason is that you received and repaid the loan today. Yes. Then your grade will get elevated. Additionally, we will further elevate your grade on our side. The reason being that there’s no record of your repayments currently; we cannot arbitrarily manipulate your data, customer. Ah, so if I only repay one, then the 80 million won comes out, right? Yes, that’s correct, customer. So if I repay one today, will it come out? Is it certain? Yes, that’s correct, customer. But, if you assume that you repay the 27 million won to BNK Capital, if you call their call center arbitrarily, we can’t request the necessary document. Ah, I see. Therefore, we will request a document from BNK Capital first. Yes. Since you will be repaying in this manner, BNK Capital will be asked to provide us with this document. Yes. Shall we request that document first and then ask you to make the payment? Is that okay? Yes. How would you like to organize that with BNK Capital? Yes. Are you saying that the 80 million won definitely comes out? Don’t worry about that; if you go forward, it seems you have about 57,610,000 won remaining with BNK Capital. Yes. So, regarding that 61,000 won, we will deduct it for next month’s interest as a prepayment, and you can fully settle just the 27 million won. Should I request that document for you, customer? Yes. What should I do? Ah, then I will contact Assistant Manager Kim Jae-sung to prepare the document. After that, please call Assistant Manager Kim Jae-sung again. I will let you know to call him, customer. Yes, I understand. Yes, I understand, customer. Yes.",,1
"Hello, this is Manager Choi Yong from the BK Capital Debt Recovery Team. Yes, thank you for your hard work. Hello? Yes, please go ahead. Yes, I would like to repay some money. Yes. By the way, have you received any requests from Nonghyup? Ah, yes, could you please confirm your resident registration number's first six digits for verification? Yes, OOOOOO. Yes, I confirm that you are Mr. OOO. Yes, that's correct. Yes, currently you are utilizing our expected loan. Yes. Yes, I have received a request for your correspondence from NH Nonghyup. Yes, I would like to request both a data transfer request and a corporate repayment certificate. Yes, these two requests have come in. Yes. If you repay the full amount to us, Yes. Are you trying to receive a low-interest loan from Nonghyup? Ah, that's not the case; I need to manage my credit rating. Yes, yes. Yes, so I... Yes, customers who are unable to obtain loans from financial institutions often consult through counselors and repay existing loans after increasing their repayment capability to qualify for new loans. Ah, is that so? I hope that’s the case. Because the requests you made are similar to such cases... Ah, I see. That's why I provided you with the information. Yes, since you are not a customer, I need to inform you that you must fully repay the loan before we can send out the correspondence you requested, including the corporate repayment certificate and the data transfer request. Yes, I understand. Yes, without repayment, we... How do I proceed with the repayment then? Yes, I will guide you through the repayment process now, sir. Yes. Yes, please wait a moment. Yes. Yes, hello. Yes. Yes, Mr. Customer, you have contacted the Debt Recovery Team. Yes. Yes, can you note the current early repayment amount? Yes. It is 27,743,337 won. 337 won? Yes. Can you please repeat the amount? 27,743,337 won. Yes, and the contact person is OOO. OOOOOOOOO yes. Yes. The payment account has been viewed at the corporate bank. Yes, that's correct. Can you note that down? Yes. It’s the corporate bank. Yes. OOOOOOOOO, yes, Mr. Customer. Regarding the payment account, it was viewed at Busan Bank yesterday… Yes, that’s right. Because you requested this, our Debt Recovery Team has been asked to process your payment. Yes, I have assigned a contact person and provided the account information. Ah, yes. The contact time for this account is Yes. Currently, NH Nonghyup processes it in the morning. Yes. So, only 15 minutes are available for viewing. Yes. Because we need you to make the payment within 15 minutes. Yes. Could you contact us again after making the payment? Yes, I understand. Yes, and how do you plan to make the payment? I will do it through internet banking. Ah, it’s online banking you are using. Yes. Yes, the bank you will be using for the payment is the corporate bank, right? Yes, that’s correct. Yes, it’s the corporate bank, and it has been available for 15 minutes, so please make the payment and contact us. You must pay 27 million won at once. Yes, I understand. Yes, thank you. Yes.",,1
"Hello? Hello? Yes, ah yes, nice to meet you. So, um... we will deposit the vehicle price in three parts. Yes, initially, we will deposit the down payment of around 20 million won. Yes. Once we deposit the down payment, we'll buy the vehicle under your name anyway. Yes, you can withdraw it and hand it over to our salesperson. Yes, yes. Then the salesperson will go to our direct store, which we deal with in Busan. Yes, they will go to that branch and deliver the down payment first. Yes. The intermediate payment will be deposited at the time when you come back. Yes, about an hour before or after. Yes, then go to Nonghyup to get the intermediate payment and hand it over to our salesperson. Yes, then at the end, the remaining balance of 60 million won will be settled, right? Yes, yes. At that time, you and our salesperson need to go together to the Kia dealership. Ah yes, yes. There, please read the vehicle purchase contract in detail. Yes, sign it, and you can't receive the 6 million won from our salesperson at that dealership. Yes. The dealership employees think about borrowing names, so before we sign the contract, the salesperson will briefly call you over. Yes. We will give you a 6 million won commission and get the signature. Then the vehicle purchase will be completed on that day. Ah yes. The time will end between 11 o'clock at the latest, and at the earliest, it will finish at 3 o'clock. So, during that time, I am asking you to keep your schedule open. Ah yes, yes, yes. Yes, sometimes some customers think that this may cause a disadvantage to them. But there is no disadvantage because it will be in your name. If you take out a loan or lease, it may become a problem later. Yes. Yes, but if you pay the entire amount in cash and sign the contract on the day of purchase, you would have received a 10% commission deposit based on the vehicle price before signing the contract, right? Yes. This means everything is settled. Ah, usually, if you buy a vehicle for cash these days, it will be delivered within 10 to 12 days. Yes, yes, on the day of delivery, our sales staff will go down together to Busan. Yes. You will need to take about an hour and a half for the name transfer, right? Yes. Yes, the vehicle will be under your name, but in reality, it is a company vehicle. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yes, that's how it will be settled. Yes. So, between Monday and Friday, on a weekday when you can keep your schedule open from 11 to 3 or 4, yes. If you set a schedule, our sales staff will visit you in Busan. Ah, then if you want to proceed, when will it be possible, like this Friday? This 5th is Arbor Day, right? Yes. Yes, then since it's a public holiday, it won't be that day... Yes, it doesn't matter. Ah, then next week… is it possible on Monday, April 9th? Ah, then we usually purchase about six to seven vehicles a day, since it is all cash. Yes, we plan accordingly so that we will contact you via KakaoTalk. Yes. I will contact you using (name)'s phone number to my personal KakaoTalk, but I don't use KakaoTalk separately. Ah… then you need to use a messenger. Ah… just a moment, I will install KakaoTalk now. Yes, then please add me on KakaoTalk with that phone number. Because when you withdraw it, I will withdraw the initial deposit and hand it over to our salesperson, right? Yes. Then regarding the deposit and withdrawal, yes. If you send me a screenshot of the account transaction, we will process it as the down payment has been completed. Then the representative will send you the intermediate payment and the remaining balance, along with the 6 million won commission, so we need the KakaoTalk messenger. Ah yes, yes. Then I will install KakaoTalk. Yes. Ah, I will call you back in about 15 or 20 minutes. Yes. For now, you are saying you are available around April 9th. Yes. Ah, I will tentatively reserve April 9th. Yes, yes. And I will call you again. Yes. Yes.",,1
"Yes, yes, yes. Please ask whatever you're curious about. So, originally, I found out from somewhere else that you use a corporate account, but why are we using a personal account? I can't fully understand that. It's not that we don't use it at all. We are using it. But there are people who handle that separately, and we are trying to maximize profits, so you can think of it as adding more to that. Oh, additionally? Yes, since we are now reaching a certain scale, financially, we are trying to handle more of it now. As you mentioned, we also use the corporate account to handle that. Yes, yes, we handle that, and aside from that, we are handling more externally. Externally? Yes, you understand what I mean, right? Yes, so if we rotate it through our account, legally, that would be considered money laundering, right? Well, to put it simply, it's not so much money laundering as it is, well, financial trading, right? Yes, that's right. But? Yes, later on, legally, will we not get caught? There won't be any problems. As I mentioned, the coins transfer from here to an electronic wallet, right? Yes, and then you transfer it to either a Korean wallet or a Japanese wallet like that. Since it's being monetized from that state, honestly, for example, there is no evidence that (bleep) did any currency exchange from a certain place. Yes, for example, yes. There needs to be a record that there was a transaction with the currency exchange agent, and only then can it be considered normal. Yes, there needs to be a record of (bleep) depositing a certain amount into the currency exchange account, and then receiving a certain amount in cash from that person, right? Exactly. Yes, that record doesn't exist. So, this is a normal transaction. It's not a currency exchange. Hmm... It’s not a currency exchange. So, do I have to use my account regardless? That's right. As long as it’s not a personal account in your name, well, sometimes people ask if they can use their mother's or relative's account. But we are putting money into those accounts after all. We are depositing company transaction funds there. For example, if (bleep) brings in a friend's or close friend's account. Yes. But, it's said that you can trust them, but money is something you can't know for sure. For instance, if we say to buy 3 bitcoins and then send about 40 million won, how do you know something might happen to that person in that moment, leading to an incident? If that happens, both parties and the company would be in trouble. In fact, it would be a bit ambiguous to hold (bleep) responsible for it. Yes, that's right. Since they are the one causing the loss, it would be awkward to continue working. Yes, yes. We have to recover the lost amount, so we have to keep them working. We cannot use that account, and it becomes a complicated situation. Therefore, we've explained since the beginning that we only use the accounts of current employees. Oh, so after we receive that money and buy, then we cash out, that's not illegal nor is it legal, right? It's somewhat of a loophole. There are some loophole aspects, but legally, there cannot be any sanctions on that. Hmm. Yes, I can clearly tell you that it is not illegal. It's a normal currency transaction. Yes, and also, I was going to apply for a visa earlier, but it didn’t work. Yes, yes, the visa application has to be submitted in the morning if you want it to go through that day. Oh, so I was going to resolve it today, but it can only be done in the morning? You probably need to go by 10 or 11 AM for that day’s application to go through. Hmm. So, who will be picking me up? Someone from our staff will come to pick you up. Oh, so they will take me into the office? Yes, yes, yes. Anyway, you came all the way here, and you can’t just take a taxi by yourself without anyone here, especially since you can't speak Chinese. Yes, yes, someone who can speak Korean will come and take you. Yes, I understand. Then I will contact you again tomorrow morning via KakaoTalk. What are you curious about? I've heard there's a 30-day visa and a 90-day visa. Hmm, it doesn’t matter; you can choose either. Just ask for the simplest and cheapest one for travel. Since when you come here, I have a corporate company, so we will issue you a work visa. During your working time, after that, if you obtain a work visa, you will have a visa that allows you to come and go at any time for a year. Yes, so you can just get the cheapest one. Hmm, okay, I will contact you if I have any other questions. But please send me a message first as I've been busy with external tasks, and we are currently hiring local staff. Yes, yes. I've been going back and forth for local staff interviews. Ah~ If you send me a message, I'll try to call you back as soon as possible. Yes, understood. If you have any questions, please reach out. Yes. Yes.",,1
"Yes, then is there no way for me to know that? Um, first I will explain a bit again. Yes, um, I will explain why we do it this way. Yes, you might have heard the explanation already. We have a few exchange accounts. Yes, but this account cannot exceed 2.1 billion won in a year. Yes, and if the monthly average persists at, say, 30 million won or if the annual transaction exceeds 2.1 billion won, yes, we get taxed a lot. This applies to personal accounts as well. Yes, so in the past, we used to borrow accounts from our parents, cousins, or younger siblings. Just a moment. Just a moment. I’m sorry. Yes, so we borrowed a lot, but I don’t know if you know this, but for about the past six months to a year, banks have not been issuing accounts. Yes, for account issuance, there must be a legitimate reason, like providing job medical insurance, or tax documents, etc. Yes, some sort of documentation is required. Yes, because of that, we have a lot of revenue, but we can't fully utilize it. Yes, so we devised a method where we can hire employees and give them a little time to manage this. Yes, we have been doing this for a while now, but we haven't recruited as much as we do now. Yes, the person you are speaking with is checking our transaction history regularly and making a note of all the amounts deposited. Yes, so for instance, if we look at 2.1 billion won annually, that would mean around 100 million won per month, right? So we usually keep it under 100 million won per month as much as possible. Yes, and as for the foreign exchange management law violation that you mentioned earlier, yes, this violation is something that people who come to exchange money must report. If they report it or if there are too many transactions in the account, it can be flagged. If, for instance, banks or the Financial Supervisory Service ask what this is about, and we can't provide documentation, they might question whether we exchanged money abroad. Yes, we have run into issues with the forex management law in the past and had to pay fines. There was a time when we didn’t know anything. But at this point, you don’t have to worry too much because we have our know-how and we are operating professionally. Yes, so if you really want to confirm starting tomorrow, you can call our clients as well. Yes, our clients likely wouldn't want that, but if you are very anxious, I can ask them to call you with the current number, and they can do that. Yes, yes, but you don't need to worry about such things. Yes, but is there really no possibility of me going into the police station over this? Oh, absolutely not. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And if there really is a problem with the account, if the money has not been deposited or something, you can mention my name. Yes, it's not that the bank will call you. And if, just hypothetically, you say that I received the money and then didn’t return it, what happens? If we receive the money and do not give it back, we will have the record of the conversation, even though we don’t tape record it. Yes, you provided us with your date of birth and phone number, and a bank account number as well, right? Yes, this is all documentation you provided for our transaction. Yes, if you took the money and ran, we would inform our client. Yes, we would say that this is the account for the deposit, and we would ask them to put a stop payment on it, and to handle it in whatever manner necessary. Because here, the people coming to exchange money are all local. Yes, this is one of the most tightly-knit communities in this country. Yes, it is. So if such an incident occurs, we would suffer disadvantages too, obviously. It’s a situation where we could be borrowing someone else's account to make deposits. Right? For violating electronic financial transaction laws, we only need to pay a fine of 800,000 won. Yes, but if that person disregards repayment requests, they won't be able to use that account for a whole year. Ah~ They can't use it for a year and not only that but they can't do any banking transactions at all, they can't even open a new account. So they could conduct transactions, but only face-to-face transactions six months later at the bank branch. In simple terms, that's possible. Yes, so the reason I initially didn't mention this is that it was not my intention to threaten you with money. Yes, there's no need for me to say this, right? Right? Yes, it would only be a way to scare you. Yes, it's just words like ""This could happen"" or ""We would do this."" So I didn't mention this because we have no paperwork to prove any of it. Um, yes. If anything goes wrong, of course, we would also be affected, but if you remain tight-lipped about it, nothing would happen to you. Um, so, as I mentioned yesterday, we won't engage in transactions above 30 million won in a single account, and we will keep transactions under 15 million won; I explained all that, right? So you don’t have to worry about that. Yes, are you feeling a lot of anxiety? No, are there many like this nationwide? Ah, honestly, we have many in the Seoul area. Yes, there are many in Seoul, and currently, there are only two in Daejeon. Yes, just a moment. Just a moment. They say they have arrived at the parking lot. Ah, I see. I’m not at the parking lot right now, so just a moment; you can go out without hanging up. Yes. Ah, can you come in front of the NH Bank in Gunsan? It would be easier for us to find each other. Just a moment. Yes, go ahead. Yes, can you just go in front of the NH Bank? Ah, that's fine. Yes, just a moment. If our staff happens to know you, yes, it’s not a problem if you don't hang up while you go. Yes, (beep-) what is the friend's name? Just a moment. I'm messaging them right now. What’s going on? Are you at the parking lot? They said they are in front of the parking lot. Ah, really? Yes, I came in through the main gate, and they said they're wearing a gray long-sleeve shirt. A gray long-sleeve shirt? Yes, are they carrying any kind of bag? Just a moment, I'll ask. (Beep-) Is that you? Ah, yes, that's correct. Ah, they say that's correct. Yes. If that's the case, please give me 495,000 won. Yes, yes, then I’ll talk to you. Ah, yes, yes. Just a moment. Yes, I'm on the phone now. I'll call you. Yes.",,1
"Hello? Hello? Yes, yes, is this the right person? Yes, yes. Hello, this is a sports toto site. Yes, I’m contacting you because if you have an unused account, we can offer you an advance payment of 4 to 4.5 million won per month and rent it out. Oh, I don’t do toto, how did you get my number? Ah, have you ever registered online? No, I’ve never registered. Ah... How would I receive the money if I do it? We use it for our clients' game currency fund. Oh, I see, for 4 to 6... So if you have an unused bank account, we can offer you an advance payment of 4 to 4.5 million, and if you can do it... Can I know what site it is? It’s a sports toto site. Ah, then I’ll think about it and contact you later. Yes, understood. Yes.",,1
"I don't see it as a fraud suspect. We are somewhat speculating that you could be a victim of identity theft, but you currently have no evidence to prove that you are a victim. We are trying to assist you with the investigation to prove your victim status. Yes, as for ㅇㅇㅇ, there are no primary suspicions against you at all. So, the investigation will proceed with a telephone recording first, and since this is an important investigative material to be submitted to the court on your behalf, if there are any noises or third-party voices in the background, it will be considered abnormal, meaning we will judge that you are testifying under someone else's instruction or identity theft, so it will not be accepted as a recorded statement. Yes, I’ve briefly explained the incident; do you have any guesses about what's happening? No, I have no idea. I've never lost anything. Have you ever noticed any unauthorized login attempts or hacking attempts on social media accounts or email accounts in your name? No, and I have never publicly posted anything like that on social media. We need a bit more time for this call, but it won’t take long, so could you move to a quieter place to give your statement? Yes, sure. We will record the investigation now. Who did you say you are affiliated with earlier? I am Investigator Kwon Jeong-ri from the Second Team of the Intelligent Crime Investigation Unit at the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office. Are you alone right now, or are you somewhere quiet? No, I'm by myself. Okay, then I'll continue to address you. Yes. First, I'll mention that we will record the statement, but before the recording, I need to tell you a few precautions. Above all, please answer honestly and carefully as this is important for you. The investigation agency, under the Personal Information Protection Act, does not require personal information such as your residential number, account number, or PIN during phone recordings. Yes, if you are asked about these things, please do not mention them. You don't have to worry about it since I'm not requesting it either. Yes, in the investigative process, you can simply answer whether you know or do not know. Yes. Then I will start the recording now. First, can you please state your name for the recording? Yes, it’s ㅇㅇㅇ. You are ㅇㅇㅇ, and do you know a 38-year-old man named Kim Hee-cheol who currently resides in Gwangmyeong, Gyeonggi Province? No, I do not. Do you know if you had received bank accounts from our bank and Hana Bank at the Cheolsan branch in Gwangmyeong around March 2017? No, I have not. Were you aware that a bank account in your name was opened and used as a dummy account in a crime? No, I was not aware. Have you communicated separately with someone named Kim Hee-cheol and agreed to receive financial benefits while conversing? No, there was none. These two accounts have been frozen to prevent additional victims, as they were used for criminal activity. Do you know what it means to be frozen? Ah, it means that you can no longer use them, right? Yes, that's correct. It refers to halting usage and payment so that they cannot be used for criminal activities anymore. The balance in those accounts will be restricted until we conclude our investigation without questioning the source. Yes, any additional accounts that may arise beyond the accounts you are normally using will be considered as dummy account use for some amounts, so we will take action to freeze everything until the investigation is closed to prevent secondary damage. Yes, we have discovered accounts at our bank and Hana Bank, and we are in the process of filtering out any accounts that you did not personally open. If you are currently using a bank that is functioning normally, please simply state the bank name. It’s KB Kookmin Bank. So you are currently using only one KB Kookmin Bank, right? Yes. Do you have any other bank accounts that you personally opened but do not use? No, I do not. If you do have any, they would likely be classified as dormant accounts if there have been no transactions within the past six months due to recent dummy account incidents. Since many cases are used for criminal activities without your awareness, please visit the branch to close it if you do not intend to use it anymore. Yes. You said that you are currently using only KB Kookmin Bank and that one account is used for the country love card at the Military Manpower Administration, and the other at Hana Bank is for the student ID benefit card, right? Yes. And lastly, for the sake of deposit protection, we will verify that. You mentioned having one checking account at Nonghyup Bank, and currently, you have a normal account at KB Kookmin Bank and Hana Bank, so how much do you have deposited in both banks as of today? I haven’t checked Hana Bank; it has been over a year, so I really don’t know. As for KB Kookmin Bank, I think it’s around 130,000 won. I understand. If you stop using Hana Bank, please consider pausing or closing it. Yes. Especially because you are currently enrolled in school, your personal data can be leaked significantly through general student IDs or through department clubs or student meetings, so accounts that haven't been used for a long time pose a high risk of being used as dummy accounts. Therefore, please always pay attention to that part. Yes. The simple investigation is now complete, and later on, we will send you the investigation report and a summons based on your current residence under your name, so if you get another contact, please do not miss it and respond well. Yes, I understand.",,1
"This is Investigator Kim Do-young from the Financial Crime Investigation Team 1. (Beep) Is this you? Yes. Do you know a person named Kim Hee-sun, a 42-year-old woman from Masan, Gyeongnam? No, I don't know her at all. I see. Is it true that on October 16, 2017, you opened two accounts at the Gyeongnam Bank and the Kookmin Bank in Yangdeok-dong, Masan, Gyeongnam? No, it’s not true. Those two accounts were found at an illegal site, so they have been frozen without your consent. Do you know what it means to have your accounts frozen? No, could you explain it to me? Yes, freezing means that the accounts are in a state where no illegal funds can be deposited or withdrawn. Currently, because (beep) aside from the two accounts you are registered with, additional accounts that you are unaware of have been discovered, so I will ask you a few questions regarding the financial sector. Yes, before I ask, the investigation agency does not request any personal information or financial information from individuals. Yes. Please keep this in mind and feel free to answer. Can you tell me the banks you currently use or their names? Nonghyup and Kookmin Bank. Nonghyup and Kookmin Bank. Yes, you should mention any bank where you opened accounts. Are you referring to the region? Yes, are you talking about the region? No, I mean you should tell me all the banks where you opened accounts, not just Nonghyup and Kookmin. Do you have others? No, I don't have any. So how many accounts do you have in these banks, and what types are they? I have two accounts in Nonghyup. What kind? They are both checking accounts. One is for deposits and withdrawals. Yes, for deposits and withdrawals. And the other one, just a moment... that's also a deposits and withdrawals account? Yes. How about Kookmin Bank? That’s also a deposits and withdrawals account, but it's a transportation card. Ah, I see. Then do you have any savings accounts, time deposits, subscription accounts, or overdraft accounts? I don’t have savings. My mother might have a savings account in my name, but I’m not sure about that. Oh, you’re not sure? That’s the part that is most concerning, so we need to confirm it. Do you have any way to check the Nonghyup or Kookmin accounts through an app? I have the app installed. Then could you please check it? Yes, just a moment. I’ll go into the app. Yes. Please take your time. It might take a while; is that okay? How long do you think it will take? I've just found it... take your time. Is this a voice phishing situation or something? Then how can we assist you in checking on that? I’ve never done this before. Oh, oh yes. What should I check? What are you referring to? I opened the Nonghyup app. Yes, yes. Didn't I ask you to check something? For deposits and withdrawals, we need to confirm the amount for depositor protection registration. So could you tell me how much is in the deposits and withdrawals accounts, approximately? Just a moment. Yes, one account has about 87,000 won. Yes, under 100,000 won. The other one also... hello? It has about 1,000 won. It seems like there’s another account. Yes, what’s that? I think it has 20,000 won. Yes, confirmed. So you’re saying that all three accounts total less than 200,000 won? Yes. Yes, what about Kookmin Bank? I can’t confirm that, but it will probably be under 50,000 won. You mentioned your parents possibly having savings accounts or subscriptions and that you didn’t know anything about them? Yes. You don't know even approximate details? But when I checked, it seems like there's nothing my mother has separately opened in my name. Ah, there's nothing? Then we will contact the Financial Supervisory Service and cross-check. If there were transactions of several millions, we will contact you again and conduct a re-investigation. Otherwise, for now, (beep) we will conclude the case here. Understood. Yes, you don’t need to worry too much. We will contact you again once the case is completely resolved. Understood. Yes, thank you for your hard work.",,1
"We are currently assisting with alternative loans through debt currency rights. However, we are not located in Busan. We work from our branch in Gwanggyo, Seoul, which is closer to Busan. The reason we need to do this is that when we keep communicating with customers through our main phone line, it becomes difficult to process with the credit department and our alternative loan department together. Therefore, we are having Kyujin Kang work in the Busan area. Yes, yes, for the customer, you have submitted your application and proceeded, but you need to decide whether you will handle it yourself, as it’s not registered with the bank yet. Um, yes, right? We counsel customers who are registered with us as loan brokerage firms and then after consulting with the designated person, if the customer registers the necessary parts, we can proceed, but that part needs to be verified before we submit it to the main office. That is when you can confirm it. However, at this moment, you can check, but time-wise, you can’t confirm it right now. Yes, and for the registration case, it has been authenticated by you, and if you call the main office tomorrow, you will be able to verify it. I know it’s getting late, but is there any way for me to confirm? At this time, there isn’t. So… if you had told me earlier… what I’m saying is that if you receive official documents from Rush & Cash, we can handle the repayment process which includes monthly interest, transaction maintenance costs, and management code costs, and if you don’t… If so, then I apologize for keeping you late with my call, but do I have something like a fax to receive confirmation? A fax… We have to provide it to you, but we can’t disclose certain parts via fax right now. The funds are not currently released. If we handle this carelessly, it’s government funding, so we would receive a call from the government support department. Then I would only be dealt with disciplinary actions. For matters we offer to customers, it has to be confirmed tomorrow. I can assist you in any way possible, but let me tell you one more thing. Yes, if you believe it's not 980,000 won but 5 million won, that’s what it is... Yes... No, I meant that the higher amount is... No, the 5 million was confirmed by Rush & Cash. That case is settled now. If the 980,000 won gets lost in the middle, consider it that way. I received the credit loan from another person's agreement. Yes, but let me clarify. Yes, yes, what do you mean? I’m sorry for doubting, but no, no, from your perspective, that’s understandable. Because my father and mother experienced something like this. I understand that part but yes, yes, yes, I will do my best to ease your concerns through my words as much as possible. There’s nothing I can do. If we can show you something, we can certainly show it. What’s not there is not there; that’s for sure. I can’t help it. Even though I want to send you everything by fax while taking the brokerage fees, I can’t do that. But I can assure you that there’s no reason for the 980,000 won to be lost. Because we processed the application with Rush & Cash and have you verified your repayment status, right? Yes. Then you should already have that confirmed. If we were a fraudulent company, you wouldn’t be able to verify any of it. And you could have checked with Ye Garam right away. I wish you had contacted them directly about your confirmation since it would have been more beneficial for you. We have data transfer records, and upon checking what we processed, it indicates you repaid with the account linked to Rush & Cash, correct? Yes, yes, yes. We verified and processed everything through government assistance. If you were able to confirm Rush & Cash, that wouldn’t have been resolved without our help. Right? Correct? Because we have paid the monthly interest fees, the management code fees, and even the transaction cancellation costs. Right? Without our help, your Rush & Cash would not be resolved. But it is resolved now. So over the 980,000 won, there is no need for you to worry in this way. You only proceeded with the repayment of 5 million, right? Have we ever demanded any fees or anything from you? Has anyone ever made such a requirement? No, that wasn't done. Yes. Right. Then you naturally know that in case of early repayment penalties on the loan, that if you’ve had a loan before. Right? Correct. And you haven’t incurred any costs for that, as we have paid them, right? And you clearly said that Rush & Cash had been settled, correct? You said you verified that, didn’t you? Well, I mean, I immediately reached out after 7 PM, and since there was no response, I thought, “Oh, I’ve been taken,” because I contacted you but you didn’t answer. From my perspective, that’s the only conclusion I could reach. Yes, it’s true. I received sudden notification and had to go to the payment department right away, and because of that, I couldn’t ask for a transfer to the personnel responsible for this before heading down. So that’s why I came up here confused after processing everything. Alright, I understand. You understand, right? With Rush & Cash, you have only dealt with the principal amount of 5 million won. Since we handled this, it’s been processed for you. You have confirmed this, right? You do understand this, right? It’s the same in Ye Garam; we also paid management code costs, monthly interest fees, and transaction cancellation costs for you, totaling 7 million won. And you confirmed that you only paid 980,000 won. Ah, can I check with the credit finance company and mention your advisor's name to verify that? You can check tomorrow. Oh, really? I understand. Yes, I will call you tomorrow morning. Yes, probably between 9 AM and 10 AM, I will reach out to assist you with the process. Yes, I understand. But think about it, you have no doubt with Rush & Cash because you have confirmed that everything has been processed directly, right? But the reason why I’m feeling a bit unsure is because, regarding this year, nothing from my account has been spent, and today, I made an immediate deposit, right? Yes, you processed the repayment right away. Yet, even if you made a repayment immediately and later canceled it, the transaction cancellation fees, management code costs, and monthly interest fees will still occur. The early repayment penalties apply. Yes… Those we covered for you to settle it, right? Otherwise, it wouldn’t be settled, right? You wouldn’t have undertaken this for the first or second time, so you’re aware of these incurred costs, right? We have paid that for you, so you’re cleared. It would have been nice to have something reliable on our end today. Ah, time-wise, it’s unavoidable. Yes, think about it simply. You are probably worried because you suddenly had this happen from 7 PM, and you’ve had past incidents that lead to this concern, but simply think it through, and you will find the answer. To settle with Rush & Cash, it’s natural that additional costs will occur with the transaction’s other parts. You should have confirmed if you processed the repayment or if we processed it for you, but ultimately you confirmed your settlement with Rush & Cash, haven’t you? Yes, I understand what you’re saying. You need to leave soon, so don’t worry. Please do contact me tomorrow. Yes, I understand. Yes.",,1
"Did I do something wrong? No, yes. I'm on the phone, yes. Just those who know will… not be well, yes. Since there's no suitable time to borrow… Ah… if I could have received a little less on the card loan, I could borrow more, but I've received all of that too. Yes, yes, yes. Ah, then… I need to look into the insurance loan a bit more, yes, yes. I need a bit more time, oh it’s Friday. Yes, yes. Then today, um… if it’s not something urgent, you can take until Monday. You can judge that for yourself. Yes, I think I need to contact you again on Monday. Even if the conditions are met, it might not work out. Yes, I understand. Then? Let’s see~ The conditions, I will make a reservation for priority on Monday as soon as possible, so please try to call over the weekend while you’re resting. And I’ll call you around nine forty after the meeting ends at nine thirty on Monday. Yes, thank you for your hard work today. Yes. Yes.",,1
"Yes, thank you. Is Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ there? Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ? Should I connect you? They’ve stepped out for a moment; what is this about? No, I’ve been reported for fraud. You’ve been scammed? What kind of fraud? I was a victim of voice phishing, so I reported it to the police. You reported it to the police? What kind of scam did you experience? They said it was used for a dummy bank account. Is it related to you? How did that happen? Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ would know that. Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ is not here; they resigned as of today. They resigned as of today? Yes, they quit today. What’s the reason? That person prompted a bank transaction while saying they would give a loan yesterday. A bank transaction? Did you give them the bank account? No, I didn't give them the account, but since the limit wasn’t set, they said a transaction was needed to get the limit. So, when that person deposited money, they would withdraw it... Did you withdraw it? Yes. They told me to inform the withdrawal team, right? So you handed over the money? How much? I can’t quite recall the total amount. Earlier you said they stepped out for a moment. They resigned, but I thought it was right to say they were out for a moment. What did the police say, if you don’t mind me asking? They’ve put a hold on the account for now. You will be punished as well, right? I haven’t received any news about that yet, and for now, I think we should wait since I’m also a victim in a way. But even if you’re a victim, you did take out money and gave it to them, right? Me? I talked to the police there, and they told me to wait a bit. You might also be treated as a withdrawal accomplice at the police station; you could face fines or even imprisonment. So for now, they told me to wait. Has a report been filed, then? Yes, and I went while working to the police station... Oh, I see. What should we do, customer? But why didn’t you answer this call? It kept getting disconnected. Us? I didn’t hang up. It kept saying it would connect in the morning, but it didn’t connect. Oh, is that so? Assistant ㅇㅇㅇ has been unreachable and has resigned. They’re unreachable?",,1
"Hello? Yes, hello. Is this [name]? Yes, this is [name] from [company]. May I ask where you live and your age? In Seoul... So, you live in Seoul? How old are you? I'm 26 years old. Are you currently doing any other work? No, I'm not working right now. First of all, I’m not sure if you saw our message, but we are a company that exports new and used cars overseas. For used cars, we have many stores and dealers, so we don't face significant issues in exporting. However, for new cars, these days, Hyundai and Kia are canceling registrations to export them as used cars. Yes, when they send them directly, they can make a profit. But since we use a workaround, the contract company becomes the principal and Hyundai Kia becomes the subordinate, right? Yes. However, the subordinate can cancel the contract these days. Ah... So there are some people who charge a small commission and handle purchases for you, which you can see on the internet. Yes, just a moment. Yes, I'm not asking you to get a car in your name, but there are many people like that, and we need to manage them. Yes, in the past, those people had no money, so we had to give them money to buy the car. But we can't just give them money. If we give 35 to 40 million won to a customer without knowing them, and they run away with it, we would be in trouble. So in the past, if we got a car in the name of a customer, Hong Gildong, we would take the contract and change the name to Hong Gildong before depositing it into the sales account. Now that’s not possible. We need to verify if it’s really the money of customer Hong Gildong. So first, we collect cards from our clients. We deposit the money there, withdraw from it, and send it to the sales office under their name without a bank transfer. That is the work we need you to do. On the contract day, you can't come for the down payment. So you have to come on the day of delivery, but you won't be able to come before that, so you send the cards via courier. You receive all of those, and once the bio is deposited, we will notify you via KakaoTalk. Then, you withdraw and go to the respective bank to make a non-account deposit. It seems easy, but there are many details involved. There are many delivery workers and people who manage contracts, and there are quite a few part-time workers. You also need to provide them with petty cash at times, so think of yourself as handling the coordination work from the outside. Where in Seoul do you live? In [specific area]. Then, in the morning, you would wait at the nearest subway station because the package might come or you might receive it directly from the customer with the cards... Yes. You wait there, and I'll let you know the time. When I inform you when the buyer will deposit, you'll wait, then withdraw and move to make another non-account deposit at another bank. Ah yes. It might be a bit difficult at first, but it’s better to move than just wait. While you are working, where will you be moving? You will be moving to an area with many banks while handling your tasks. Can't you do it from one bank? If monitoring overlaps, you might have to work with four or five banks in a day. Then you wouldn’t be able to confirm what is being withdrawn from that bank when dealing with the buyer. Ah... So to avoid overlap, you will continuously move around. Anyway, if you are starting from Yeongdeungpo Station today and there’s a package coming to Gyeongdae Station in the afternoon, you will need to move to that side while processing work and pick it up and then come back to continue working in that manner... Yes. Also, regarding payment, it’s up to your discretion. Some people take 1.5% of the total withdrawal amount, while others take 1% but have a base salary of 600,000 won. Ah, a base salary of 600? Yes, and the salary is not paid by me. Then? Think about it. You, [name], have all the cards, right? If the withdrawal amount today is 20 million won, then at 1.5%, your commission for today would be 300,000 won. Usually, you withdraw the 20 million and send about 19.5 million as a non-account deposit to the sales office, so you would have about 500,000 left in your pocket. Then, from that leftover, you take 300,000 as your commission, use 50,000 as petty cash for the day, and give the rest to the part-timers as petty cash when you go home. You take it home on the same day. It’s not difficult, right? In the beginning, the first day or two might be a little confusing for everyone. Honestly, even elementary school kids can make withdrawals, but have you ever made a non-account deposit? Yes. But when you actually go to do it, people get confused. It’s like that for everyone, regardless of age or experience. But in any case, it's repetitive work. It’s good if you can stay long-term, but if you do it short-term, you can make some money. Then I can start from the 29th, right? I have some part-time work going on right now. That's fine. Just make sure to contact me again before you officially start. Please call me. Yes, please call me. Yes.",,1
"You can think of it as an external accounting job where you collect our company's funds from assigned clients and then re-deposit them into the company. Yes, yes, you will be working on fund management. Usually, you will need to come to the site and leave the site after work. The working hours are generally from 10 AM to 5 PM, but you can think of it as starting around 10:30 AM. I've noted it down as 10 AM, but it will be a bit more relaxed than that. So, where will you be commuting to? Since it is site work, it will depend on our clients, and it varies based on the client's location. You can think of it as being all over the Seoul area. The location you go to work each day will change, but these days, if you are within the Seoul area, you can get back and forth in about one to one and a half hours by subway. Yes, yes, you don’t need to come to the office separately; you just work at the site and go home directly from there. How many places will you visit in a day? It’s not about visiting multiple places; we assign clients to you. You won’t be going to different businesses; instead, you will usually handle one to a maximum of two clients per day. The frequency of collecting our company's funds from the assigned clients and then re-depositing them is only about three times a day. It doesn’t happen that often. What kind of company is this? We provide transaction records for people who run businesses and charge a fee based on that. A fee? Yes, yes, that fee is something these people handle on their own. It’s not directly related to OOO; anyway, all sales are handled by the sales department, so there’s no need for you to do sales separately. Yes, yes, we generally deal with clients who have been trading with us for a minimum of five years up to ten years. The reason these people request transaction records from us is that OOO hasn’t run a business separately. Yes, business people need to file value-added tax returns. Yes, so there are some who want to increase the project amount because they are short on cash sales this quarter. Or there are those who want to transfer their business to someone else and want to record sales to get a higher premium. I understand. The transaction records have very diverse uses for business people, so we don’t get heavily involved in that.",,1
"Now, the first person who will be good is yes. This person is… um, here, OOO, OOO, is from Ilsan in Gyeonggi-do, right? Yes. This person is someone who knows about a mobile phone store in Ilsan, Gyeonggi-do. Yes. The person running the mobile phone store told us that the sponsorship amount of 20 million won will come in now. Yes. If the bank happens to ask what this person’s relationship is, just say he’s my older brother, my real brother. Yes. If they ask us why we need such a large amount of cash for what purpose, just say it’s for my husband’s business. Yes. Just say I borrowed some money from my brother. Yes. It’s business funds, you can just say that. Yes. When you go to the bank, and one more thing, now… when you make the deposit and transfer to the post office, right? Yes. Then, please call me first to make sure that it has been transferred properly. Yes. And then I should mention that our teacher is also a specialist in teaching students, right? Yes. Since we are also specialists in this area, yes. Today, if you just follow what I say about where to move and ask, that would be good. Yes. Anyway, you need to call me once more before entering the bank. The reason is that our clients have made repayments, but we have registered this in our system and paid the repayment amount. Sometimes, if there is no contact between me and OOO, our clients may complain, saying, “Why can’t I confirm?” Yes. It can happen, and because of that, I think we need to make calls often. Yes. So, before you enter the bank, please give me a call. Yes. Now, you've entered the bank. Yes. You’ve entered the bank, but if I can’t contact you and if it’s awkward to ask the bank clerk about the funds while we are doing account work, right? So, when you enter the bank, I won’t call you. Because you already said you were going in. Yes. But if, for some reason, the bank has a lot of business, maybe there will be a long wait. Yes, there may be too many people waiting, or sometimes there may not be many people, right? Yes. So, if the waiting line is more than, say, ten people, you can slightly go to the restroom and give me a call, or you can come out for a moment and call me. You can say that it seems you might have to wait a bit. Yes. If there aren’t many people at the counter, then you can just do your business and come out. After coming out, give me a call. For example, you can say, I withdrew this much cash and paid this much in fees, and then I will coordinate with the staff on the ground. Yes. According to the current situation, I will handle that, so you don’t have to worry about that. Yes. You can handle your work this way, but sometimes, the desk staff might pry into things. Then, since this is a matter that OOO will handle directly, we can’t assist with everything. Also, they can’t ask that person anything. So, yes. The important thing is to do these tasks so that on Monday, right? Yes. On Monday, please clearly state the part about getting the loan from Citibank. Yes. Just manage the work neatly. Yes. Yes. Now, I will register it in the system, so yes. Once the initial deposit is made, please give me a call. Oh, yes. I understand. Also, the waiting time could be about thirty minutes or so, so you can listen to some music in the car while waiting, and it would be good to postpone personal matters until after 4 PM. Oh, yes. I understand. Please call me. Yes. Yes.",,1
"Hello? Hello? Yes, yes. Ah, yes, the results for you have come out. Yes, yes. Ah, right now, our limit is 9,300 and it's at 2.6%. Ah, yes, this is primarily a virtual result from our side. Yes, yes. We will upload the virtual result to the Korea Asset Management Corporation. Yes, yes. Regarding the assets, a guarantee insurance must be issued for this amount for the loan to be executed. Ah, yes, yes. The primary examination has been completed, and for this secondary examination, there are some parts you need to apply for directly. Yes, yes. Yes, I will explain that part to you, and there’s no need for you to write it down. Ah, yes, I will read it out to you. Yes, yes. First, you don't have any problems using a computer, right? Yes, yes. Then if you search for the Korea Asset Management Corporation on Naver or Daum, KAMCO will come up. Yes, yes. Go there and create an electronic credit report. Yes, yes. Once it's completed, you need to register your certificate as a customer. Yes, yes. Are you currently using a certificate? Yes, yes. Ah, which bank's certificate are you using? It's from Woori Bank. Ah, currently it's from Hana Bank. Yes, yes. The certificates you can register with us are from NongHyup and IBK, only these two. Ah, then I guess I'll need to get it reissued from NongHyup. Yes, yes, then please get it issued from NongHyup. Is that security medium a security card or OTP? It's a security card. Ah, security cards do not work, customer. In that case, please go to NongHyup and apply without changing or discarding it. Yes, yes. Go to NongHyup and apply. You can go to any of our branches. Yes, yes. Please apply for internet banking and get it issued as an OTP. Ah, yes, yes. Then contact me once you do that, customer. Ah, yes, yes. Okay, then please receive it and contact me, customer. Yes, understood. Yes.",,1
"Sure, what is it? Oh, it's really delicious. I'll show you everything now. So in that process, we've doubled our bank account at least once, and I found something that fits me. I've checked and will contact you. Please confirm whether you are there or if you did it yourself. It's not just about money; it's not that it won't be about 200m. The important thing is that we are doing lessons. When I got home, I saw that people had from 300,000 to 500,000 won in the beef rib era part. Now what are we doing? I'm on the phone, so I'm going. I'm not doing anything, okay? Aunt, what are you doing? And you know, in front of that house, using it for airplane tickets or beds, it’s academic. The money we mentioned earlier is in that bank account. Can't work late today, so I checked the status. So regardless of whether you want it or not, because you are someone unrelated, please take a look. Today, I have two or three very serious bank accounts. I can recreate the ones I made when I was young, but I have never had money come in again. I wonder if that was because of time? On January 12, 2015, I asked to check the money right away at the security office. I'll give it to you, boss. Oh, I'll tell you about that bank account, the small one, okay? I can't go to work on Thursday; I need to buy chicken. Because of me, that’s not something I can verify, and I will give it to you. So now since there are no abnormal stories, we will do it as a third party. Please press, if possible. The first one, I will submit to the court from that road, and the second one will be through the traditional dress. The national card is locked, so I guess I have to pay that? I will check the bank transaction history for you. I’m currently asking a few questions regarding a business trip, if it's not rude, may I ask where you are working now? Or suddenly, what time is it? I will use the phone charge, so from now on, please speak firmly. If you say something else, let’s talk; I have now arrived at the airport. Whether it's money, you either know or you don’t. No, no, it’s not like that. On January 12, 2015, the bank account was during the period when there was a lifeguard from January 3 to 6 for swimming. Are there two invoices? I registered; do you agree? Is there anything that you have not verified in your wallet or ID? You can use it from your current location. I’m telling you, you can try it out for something simple like a car. Are you heading home now? Oh, then. Are you going to use it? When the salary comes in, it grows, and did you move it to that card at Jonggak Station? So what did you eat now? Ah, I can hear sounds, so then what do I do? I need to proceed again. I’m fine now. People are all about damage compensation; they have bicycles, but the time is there, so I went looking for them. Are all of them like that? Oh, this is similar in the future; I just brought it out, but you need to work on this. I will go down now. You know Kim Hyun-cheol, right? Are you going to meet and confirm? I’m going to do it, but if you write it now, you won’t be able to do it again, so let's try again. But besides that, when I went to Woori Bank with the bank manager, I’m working there. Yes, so, then like Shinhan Bank, you can do it. For example, around 200,000 won or 300,000 won, 100,000 won, 200,000 won, and 450,000 won. It’s a card for saving money, so I think there is about 200,000 won in it. So what we’ve executed until now. Please eat a lot, and we’ll start recording from now on. For example, if there is something the same, you can enter again, but it's not like that. If you know, I will contact you again; it will end, so please take a note to do it again. I’ll send it if you don’t contact me. Please check once and see if there’s anything to confirm. If you can eat something, people have come out, so shall we finish? I will check and send the real estate register. Please check once, and if there’s something, there might be. I will go soon. By the way, is there some sudden thought? I remembered something after hearing that; I had a boyfriend from 2009 to 2010, but there’s no strange person. What do I call it? I don’t know, but that person is driving a car. I had a hard time with getting a mobile phone contract back then, and I didn’t know, but I almost don’t have it. How did I save it? I wonder if that person might exist because of that. It would be possible to check the name and whatnot, so anyway, I must ask a bit more cautiously. That person is really scary; he had bothered me a lot. Now there’s a very scary person, but please don’t come back home. I’ve done all these things, so please don’t do anything. What’s happening? Please check and let me know, and if there are two of you, it’s okay. Don’t worry; it’s like today.",0.8041555881500244 0.8278904557228088 0.8376012444496155 0.8892732262611389 0.8898026347160339 0.9069782495498657 0.8200942873954773 0.8403396010398865 0.8499456644058228 0.8589630126953125 0.7769450545310974 0.7232100963592529 0.8061011433601379 0.8819303512573242 0.8743773698806763 0.8543224930763245 0.915558934211731 0.8607537150382996 0.8190432190895081,1
"It's difficult to get in touch. Regarding financial crimes and fraud cases, how is the use of that machine's account related to Mr. Channel 11 41? He is an older man and has eaten well, but there's no one here who knows him. How would I know, since almost everyone knows the CEO? I’ll briefly explain the details of the case. Last Thursday, it rained and I detained eight people. Didn't you receive the call on your phone? Now, during the trial process, he walks the path of Park Jun and frequently uses credit cards. I’m contacting you for identity verification since there are proper parts under my name. We moved, and it was quite some time in November. I checked, and there hasn’t been such an incident regarding account opening; I mentioned Sinju Corporation in Busan, but I don’t know about Mr. Park Seung-jik either. Like others, I suggest you check the Dongjak District through the police department's website, and we will provide some of the translated confirmation documents. We need to verify a few things.

"What? Three million won? Please say that again. If the customer can manage around three to five million won, yes, I can help you process the remaining amount through our support funds. But right now, the situation is quite difficult. It seems the circumstances are not favorable. Yes, I understand. Then, even if it's a small amount, please don't think that you can completely pay off the ten million won. Just let me know if you can manage the amount in advance. Because I will check how much support funds can be provided... Yes, there are quite a few parts where you can receive more, so I can assist with that. Yes, even if it’s a small amount... If it’s a small amount, what would we do? First, the full payment needs to be processed through the support funds, and that's the only way the system can work. If you pay three million won... Yes, for example, if you make a repayment of about three million won with Welcom Savings Bank, then you still have ten million won left, right? Then that means we need to provide seven million won in support funds. Yes, yes, in that case, we can approve a loan of about fifteen million won... I don't quite understand. To explain simply, if we are providing support funds of seven million won, yes, you would receive eight million won in total from our loan amount. Oh, really? Yes, yes, what I'm saying is if you have some available funds, I will ask the manager whether I can provide the support funds or not, so I'm asking you to let me know in advance. If that happens, I'll inform you of the progress. Understood. Thank you.",,1
"Hello? Yes (beep), yes. Oh, thank you for your hard work. This is investigator Koo Il-man from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office, Investigation Team 1. Yes. The reason I’m contacting you is to confirm a few things regarding a violation of the Electronic Financial Transactions Act under your name. Is it possible to speak briefly?

Yes, yes, two accounts opened in the name of (beep) at Kookmin Bank and NongHyup Bank were issued about a month ago. Currently, according to the statements of the arrested criminal Kim Kwang-ho, it has come to light that the previous bank accounts were sold directly by the account holders.

Oh, so you’re saying you haven’t at all? Yes.

No. Oh, you said no, but then, have you had your ID or personal information stolen or misused in the last three years? Hello? Yes. Can you hear me well? Yes. Have you ever lost any items? No. Um, then have you received any messages or emails indicating that your personal information has been leaked? No. Yes, currently there are people who claim they have never sold or opened anything with you, and there are direct violators of the Electronic Financial Transactions Act.

There are people who thought they had 100,000 won in their account, but actually, a larger amount came in, causing them losses. What is the last balance you had in a transaction with the bank? Can you briefly tell me how much money is in your account? For example, if it’s about 1 million won, just say 1 million won; if it’s less than that, like 5 million won, say 5 million won; if it’s 45 million won, then just say 10 million won or 100,000 won, please provide a brief index.",0.8899213075637817 0.916527509689331,1
"I contacted you regarding the identity theft issue that occurred under your name, not Eun-hee. Is it okay to talk for a moment? This is the Uijeongbu District Prosecutor's Office. We have seen your personal information, so we are reaching out because of some funds involved. I informed you that I contacted you for some verification purposes. If you find this suspicious, please come directly to the Uijeongbu District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated. Do you understand? I contacted you to help, so what are you doing? Yes, currently we have captured Kim Jeong-ho as the main suspect in a financial crime. Do you know a man in his 40s named Kim Seong-su from Gwangju, Jeolla Nam-do? During the investigation process, it was discovered that individuals were using a dummy bank account and cloned credit cards. They were found to have two financial accounts in your name at Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank. It wasn’t just about confirming the deposits in your accounts. I reached out to you regarding the bank accounts found at the crime scene in your name. We confirmed that two accounts were opened in your name on September 22, 2016, at a branch in Cheolsan-dong, Gwangmyeong City, Gyeonggi-do. Have you visited there? You haven’t, I see. Have you lost or had stolen any personal items, such as an ID card or passport, containing your personal information in the last 2 or 3 years?

"Infinite media has been swept forward. The issue is that we have discovered two financial accounts in your name at NongHyup Bank and Hana Bank from the seized crime scene. However, I have checked these two accounts through the Financial Supervisory Service and found that as of April 22, 2016, they are currently operating under your name at the Cheolsan-dong branch in Gwangmyeong City, Gyeonggi Province. Do you have any knowledge of this being developed by yourself? There is nothing in Cheolsan-dong, Gwangmyeong City. Recently, in the last three years, personal information such as ID cards, wallets, and driving licenses containing sensitive data have been leaked. Have you received any texts from the bank or platforms like Cyworld, Interpark, or social media like Naver or Facebook due to personal information leaks? It’s not that you haven’t received them, but you may not remember them. You can just speak up. I am contacting you to confirm this. We have two items we want to investigate this time. The first is that there shouldn't be any significant issues in opening an account in your name currently. However, the problem here is that I found that two financial accounts opened in your name have been used as illegal scam deposit accounts by the Kim Seong-ho gang. I want to know if you intentionally sold or transferred your account to the Kim Seong-ho gang to receive money from them, or if you have also been victimized due to personal information leakage. We plan to investigate these aspects further, which is why I am reaching out to you.",0.8937175869941711 0.8865065574645996,1

For now, the person who will work if we win is someone who used to work in real estate as a licensed realtor in the Dongdaemun area. However, we are currently dealing with this illegal gambling allegation. I'm currently at the site where we have parked, and I'm dropping off credit card results and a dummy bank account, and right now I’m calling Kookmin Bank and Nonghyup because accounts have been discovered.

For now, I want to say that the person Kim Hyun-min is working in the real estate office called Hanbit Real Estate. However, this time, we are dealing with illegal gambling charges.

However, based on the results of our attempts to review communication records from the past year and a half, there are no records of communication with individuals such as Jibanseong or Kim Hansang. Therefore, we will proceed with the primary strategy related to Gwangju. Today, I will assign you to the prosecutor in charge. Depending on the outcome today, the victim could be considered to have 700 points, and I will request the withdrawal of the complaints submitted to the court. This is because there are 140 people involved, and it would be cumbersome to deal with each one individually.

This year, he is a man in his 40s who works at NongHyup Bank and is someone you don't know at all. This is because he did something in 2006 that the prosecution told him to do. During the process, he knows well about a friend whose policies involve NongHyup Bank and Hana Bank and the work of bringing a machine. He was told to hand over the bank books, but is that true? Account number.

These people were advertising and did not have an office, but items seized from that office included fake bank accounts and cloned credit cards and security cards. In addition, counterfeit identification cards and hotel singer ceilings were seized, and during the process of seizing those items, accounts under my name with NH Bank and Hana Bank were discovered. Therefore, I called you to confirm the facts, but after checking with the financial institution in the evening, I found that it was indeed sent.

Many people are involved in what happened: Kim Hyun-cheol's group registered as sellers online and posted that they would sell expensive airline tickets and gift certificates at a lower price. They would inform those who contacted them about the account number of a proxy bank and promised to send the goods after receiving the money, and it was a fact that the money was immediately taken. This is a fraud case, where people sent money using their mobile bank accounts, and there are stored expressions showing that they transferred money to buy goods but did not receive anything. Since they couldn’t contact later, it ceased to be a transaction and I now regard it as a fraud case. I am currently in the process of filing a complaint based on self-accusation due to the seller.

Please listen to what I have to say about Mr. Lee Dong-ho, a 42-year-old man. The investigation team recently studied the financial fraud group, which has seven members, and they had a main operator. These individuals are currently using fake accounts with stolen identities, including accounts at Kookmin Bank and Nonghyup Bank. That’s why I’m contacting you for verification. Are you aware of Kookmin Bank? Where do you sell or rent them? Are you not a participant? They are currently using accounts under your name, so I need to check about this. I will tell you that there has been no loss since around March 2015, and I will explain everything, so please listen until the end. The bank account has been used as a fake account for five days, and they lost 60 million won during the day. There are currently about 30 members involved in this case, some of whom have sold their accounts for money, and some are victims of personal information leakage. From the prosecutor's office's perspective, this case involves individuals selling accounts for money. Do you understand? Please listen to my explanations. They used your real account to deposit money after attending three sessions, and 20 million won was taken by the voice phishing scheme by the Lee Dong-ho fraud group.

Now, whether this incident around 10 o'clock is a problem or a victim due to information leakage, I will first conduct a preliminary investigation with a call recording.

The next day, March 3, 2015, around 1:40 PM, was there an account at Kookmin Bank in Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul? You said there wasn’t. Can you sell or transfer your bankbook to others? Have you seen any funds being deposited or withdrawn that you don't know about? You said you don't remember. Have you ever lost your identification certificate like a resident registration card, driver's license, or passport in the past year? You said no. Do you have relationships with Kookmin Bank or Nonghyup Bank? You said none, just Nonghyup. Do you use internet banking, telephone banking, or smart banking? You said no to all three. Do you receive transaction details via text message? Is everything you've said up until now true? I want to reiterate that this incident is big in scale; when apprehended, it could involve 8 billion won. Did you receive any information about more than 40,000 leaked accounts from Nonghyup and Kookmin last year? You mentioned that your personal information leakage led to opening a fake account, suggesting that there may be more illicit transactions with other banks as well. Our urgent procedure now is to track the accounts to prevent further harm. Do you have anything else to say? Should I continue speaking?

Please tell me the approximate amount you have with the relevant financial institutions. I will relay this to my company when I arrive. Please divide your cash and liquid funds accordingly.
