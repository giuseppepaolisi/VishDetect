"Your name, please. The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to check to see if you've seen anything that indicates that you've been financially harmed by the occurrence of a tin account.

Yeah.



Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. So the tin can account thing, it's actually, as I explained to you, it doesn't matter how much money is in this account. It doesn't matter how much money is in this account.

Yeah.

I mean, even if I check it once, I can't actually verify that it's actually the amount of money that I want until I try to withdraw it, and if I try to withdraw it and it doesn't come out the way I want it to come out, then the party can actually say, ""Oh, this is a tin can account,"" and then I can take some more out. So, uh, so, uh, the thing that I need to check is, uh, I think I'm going to have to go to the Nonghyup Bank in person, and I'm going to have to go to the Nonghyup Bank in a little bit, and I'm not going to be able to take the passbook and go find the money.

Yeah, right.

It doesn't make sense, yeah, it doesn't make sense, so I think it would be a hassle for me to have to make the trip myself and just go to the bank for a while.

No, I think we can do it tomorrow.

Tomorrow?

Yes.

I need to come in today while I'm being investigated, can I not?

Oh, I'm at work. I'll get it. I'll get it.

Why don't you just talk to your boss and get out of there, or we're doing that investigation now, too, and it's focused on the financial sector, and if you're a victim of a case that I've investigated myself, I can't be responsible for it because I'm now in charge of it, and I can't be responsible for the way I investigated it and the way I concluded it, and I can't return the money.

Yeah, yeah.

If I've been victimized, even though I've been investigated, how can I be responsible if I've been victimized, uh, if I've been victimized, uh, if I've been victimized, I can't give you my money because I can't give you my property. Yeah I can't give you my money and I'm a victim of that and I can be a victim of that, so if you could, uh, if you could, uh, if you could, uh, if you could just talk to your supervisor right now and see if you can get some clarification. You know, we didn't force you to go through with it, we didn't force you to go through with it, but we did tell you that it would be good for you to go in person, if you can, and if you can do it over the phone, and if you can, it would be good for you to take the time to go through with it with your private attorney.

Uh-huh.

So I think you understand that and we're not comfortable with forcing you to do it either, because we're in the position of doing the investigation, and we're not comfortable with that either, so I think it's best to proceed with your consent as much as possible.

Uh, I'm gonna go to the bank. My bankbook is at home.

So verifiable means that I'm like, okay, I'm like, okay, I'm like, okay, I'm like, okay, I'm like, okay. For example, I gave the banker my passbook, and some people have been known to ask the teller, ""Oh, how much money is in this account? For example, I gave them a passbook and I gave them a passbook with a million dollars in it and I said, ""How much money do I have in my passbook right now?"" Of course, they're talking to you as they see it. They're saying, ""Oh, I have a million dollars in my passbook right now,"" but they're saying, ""That's just a number."" For example, if I really need money and I need to find the money and spend it or not, I need to check if it's coming out or not, but it's a tin account and it's just checking to see how much money is there. But it's a mistake to think that you don't have a tin account.

So I have to take it all out?

You can withdraw it, but the account itself will be checked with the financial regulator after a while, because I have to trace how your name is being used, so I will try to check it after a while, and then I will say that you have the money now.

Take it.

Yeah, so there's a process where you have to go through a checking account, and that process itself is now ongoing, and if it doesn't go through, if it doesn't go through, how can we help you, I'm not a banker, am I?

Oh, right.

I mean, if I were a branch manager, I would check it myself, but I'm not in a position to do that, so I'm asking you to legally check it.

Oh.

If you can, I'll give your boss a little bit of leeway, but I've got a little bit of an emergency, and I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to just tell him that you're going to have to go out of town, and you'll be out of town until next week, and then you can check it out, and you're not asking him to harm you or harm your account.

Yeah.

So I guess it wouldn't be a bad idea to make the rest of the deposit, which is why I did it.

I talked to him, though, and I went out to the bank.

Yeah. Is there any reason at all for that?

We can talk about it, we can go out for a little bit.

Oh, you can leave for a minute?

I think I need to talk to you.

Talk?

I need to talk to the boss so I can get out.

So I'm going to do it this way, even if I tell my boss, even if it's a third party, even if it's a third party, even if it's a third party, even if it's a third party, even if I'm not watching to see if they're talking to me, even if they're talking to me, even if they're talking to me, it might be a little bit of a hassle because they might be worried that I'm going to come out now or I'm going to go outside now and I'm going to take care of some business and I'm going to take care of some banking business and I'm going to go to the bank and I'm going to tell my boss that I'm under investigation.

Yeah, yeah.

So first of all, I'll give you some time, I'll talk to your boss for a minute, and then I'll look at what you've packed, and there's not much. I think it's a good idea to pack a bag in case you've lost your ID or a notepad.

Yeah, yeah.

Okay. I'm gonna give you a minute, but don't hang up and uh, you can talk to your boss and then you can talk to me.

Oh, don't hang up?

Yeah, so I'm gonna go ahead and record it.

Uh-huh.

Okay. Okay, when you get out, just tell me.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Yes

Yes how

I'm gonna change. It's my work clothes. I'm gonna change and I'm gonna be a banker.

How do you get around, what kind of transportation do you need to use?

You can walk. The cooperative is

How many times will it take?

It takes about 15 minutes.

I'm a little worried that there might be some rogue bankers out there. I'm worried about that. I'm worried about that. I'm going to get everything ready, and you can tell me as soon as you step outside.

Okay.

Okay, okay. I'll be right back.

Hello?

Yes, yes (beep-)

Yes, yes, I'm going to Nonghyup.

So now you're going to make the move, and before you make the move, I'm going to tell you that you can make the move, but don't go straight to this bank, and we can do it together, and I'm just going to take a moment, because this is a case where we're following the instructions of the Financial Supervisory Service, and just in case there's an unforeseen event, and there might be a rogue bank employee involved, so we're going to make the move, and we're going to do it at a little bit of a distance, and we're going to record what you do when you get to the 100 meters or 200 meters, and we're going to record what you do at that point.

Ah.

So we're going to make that move, but we're not going to go right in, we're going to have a little bit of a call from a little bit of a distance.

Okay.

Okay. Okay, I'll just give you a second, and I'll put the phone in my pocket and move on.

Okay.

Yes, sir.

Hello?

Yes, yes, yes, yes.

We're here

You're here. Then don't go into the Nonghyup Bank one. Yes, if you see around that area, is it in Daegu Bank? Daegu Bank.

Yes, I have it.

Daegu Bank is not far away, right?

Yes, it's nearby.

Okay. The Financial Supervisory Service has now talked about that one time, and I'm very worried that there's a rogue banker in my nonghyup bank account, because before I check the can account, I'm going to check if the CMA card is now transferred from my nonghyup bank account to Daebu bank account.

Oh, yeah.

You don't have funds in your Nonghyup bank account?

No

The funds themselves have all the deposits and withdrawals and all the deposits. Right now.

Yeah.

I'm gonna have to keep checking the deposits to see if I'm a tin can or not.

Oh, yeah.

So even if you have a deposit, you're going to have to self-deposit all of your funds, which means you're going to have to apply to cancel your deposit.

I have to do it all?

Yes you do, and then after a while you'll be able to track the account, and then you'll be able to apply to return it, and then when you've done the checks, if all the funds are now legitimate and transparent, then I'll be able to designate them as deposits again, if they're deposits, because I'll be able to see that they're legitimate funds.

Yes. Yes.

So don't think that I'm taking advantage of my parents for the interest part or anything like that. The important thing is that now you have to put in a request to terminate the deposit. Because you don't have a passbook, you don't have a passbook, so when you go in, you have to apply for a replacement with your ID, and after you apply, all the funds are there, right? All the funds in Nonghyup Bank

Yes.

Please transfer all funds to Daegu Bank. Transfer all funds

Full transfer?

Yes, I'm going to transfer the entire amount to my bank account, Daegu Bank, and I'm going to see if the CMA code follows the CMA code from the Nonghyup bank card to the Daeboo bank card, and then I'm going to check something, and I'm going to check the tin can account with the Daegu bank card.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

You understand.

Yes, I understand

And then when you go into the bank, now you have a rogue bank teller, they may ask you if you've been investigated for the theft in Mr. Lee's name, or if you've been investigated by the police, or if you've been investigated by the police, or if you've been investigated by the police, and you can just evade that question and just say no.

Okay.

I'm the same way, and I want to make this as easy as possible for you, and I want you to put all of your funds into your bank account, and when you're done, please step outside and don't talk to me in the bank.

Yes, sir.

If there's a rogue bank employee, I can record it, so don't make any other calls, and when you're done and you're outside and you're moving to the Daegu bank, call me right then and I'll get you back on the phone.

But first, you need to get a new passbook and cancel all of them and deposit the money into the Daegu Bank deposit and withdrawal account, right?

That's right.

Okay.

Not too complicated, right?

Yes

Okay. So I'm going to hang up the phone again, but if you're going to come out and make the move to Daegu Bank, please contact me right here.

Where? Can I call you at this number?

Yes, you can call me right here on this number. Because I'm recording

Yes

Um, okay, I'll look forward to hearing from you. Yes.

I'm waiting for the receipt to be confirmed, but the rest of the difference hasn't been confirmed yet, so I'm waiting for the receipt to be confirmed. Yes Yes I'm waiting for the receipt to be confirmed. Yes Yes I'm waiting as long as I can.

Does this have to be finalized by today?

Once it's confirmed in the computer, yes, you should have no problem calling the billing department and getting the funds. Isn't there a bit of a delay in the loan time with a debit card like this one?

Uh, yeah.

So, since you've exhausted your debit card, which is 23 million won, we're not going to give it to you randomly.

Can you text me that?

Ah in that case would you be okay with me doing that?

Can you text me the account

Yes, I'll text you once I've verified the receipt and put it up in the payments department and gotten your funds.

Oh, and you'll have to sign electronically, too. I don't have a cell phone.

You can sign electronically, or we'll have to...

If you sign in person. I'm gonna need a deputy to help me.

Which one?

I told you to sign it.

If you don't have an electronic signature, you can sign the email with a registered letter.

Yes

Isn't it time for us to stop receiving it?

Yes I was told I had to sign something electronically to receive the funds, but my phone doesn't work.

So they told me to take it and ask the agent?

Oh, you don't see an electronic signature?

Yeah, I just got the app, but it won't go through.

If you register your customer information, you can e-sign...

Customer Loan. I entered something, and it came up.

Wait a minute.

Then I don't see it.

You should be able to see that, but if you don't e-sign that, you'll have to send us the paperwork twice.

You can do it by hand, but there's a verbal thing.

That's gonna have to be recorded again.

Yes, with the recording... No, that's...

Oh, sure. Then I'll call you back with a fax when I get this funded.

Do you want me to take that and do it first?

Yes, please... Yes, sir, I can't leave until I receive your funds.

Okay, okay, I'll wait then.

Yeah, I'll let you know as soon as I get the receipt, and I'll get up to the billing department as soon as I can, hopefully before six-thirty, so I can help you out as quickly as I can.

Okay, okay.

Okay, okay.

Yes, yes

Where are you? Now

是否?

Where are you now?

I just got out.

Oh, from which bank.

Nonghyup.

You're from Nonghyup Bank, and I told you not to check your can account and try to transfer to Daegu Bank, did you try to do that?

No. I'm on my way.

I'm going from the Nonghyup Bank account to the Daegu Bank account.

Yes.

What does it mean that you drew the money yourself?

Uh, yeah?

Your money. You said you just got paid, which funds did you draw from?

The money I have.

I explained to the Financial Supervisory Service and they told me to try to transfer the funds I have to the Daegu Bank account first. How much did you try to transfer?

I'm on my way. I have all the money.

You have the money?

Uh-huh.

What kind of money do you have

It's from the agricultural cooperative.

How much did you get? You didn't tell me to get it. You didn't tell me to get it.

and transfer it to me.

No, I'm not talking about withdrawing and transferring, I'm talking about trying to transfer it to Daegu Bank first, and then move it to Daegu Bank, and then we will receive the funds from the bank account. I'm not talking about receiving the money from Nonghyup Bank directly.

Doesn't it matter if I have it anyway?

I don't mind, but why are you acting like this?

Why not?

What's your police station? What's your attitude? What's your attitude? What's your attitude? Are you saying you're going to investigate? Are you saying you're not going to do it now? What? Are you worried? No? I mean, exactly.

No, because I recorded myself earlier.

Yeah. Yeah.

It has nothing to do with me, Mr. (bleep). You're threatening me because I recorded it. Do you think I'm going to fall for that?

Oh, I voted with my own money, is that not allowed?

If you're going to do what you want to do, come out and do it yourself.

And then I'll go back to

If you're going to do it yourself and personally, why don't you just do it yourself, and I'll contact you?

I'll call the Seoul District Attorney's Office and give them a call.

You can do that. I didn't ask for anything from you, but if you personally acted on the phone, I'll call the Seoul Prosecutor's Office to investigate your arrest. I know you know and I texted you, so hang up xxx.

Yes, sir. Hello, I'm Goeun Kim from Hyundai Capital's payment department.

Yes, hello.

Yes, hello. I'm sorry for the late hour, but I'm calling about a transfer, but, uh, is everything okay right now?

No, I was just waiting.

Oh, you've been waiting? Can you just quickly check your date of birth for a quick personal identification check?

Yes OOOOOO

Yes Is the phone you're using in your name?

Yes

Yes The cell phone you are using is identified as Elgee Uplus, is that correct?

Uh, yeah, that's right.

Yes, we just need you to confirm the account number where you received the funds.

Yes, Kookmin Bank

Yes, OOO

Yes, that's right.

You set up a direct debit to the same account at Kookmin Bank, and you set the payment date to the tenth of each month, sir.

Yes, that's right.

The interest rate is 8.75%, and the monthly interest, including principal and interest, is 4.75%, but now there's a slight increase, so you'll be receiving 7.75%. The interest rate remains the same at 8.75% APR, and your payment will be $450.00, including principal and interest.

Okay. Okay.

Yeah, yeah, so that's no change from what you were told. Okay, sure. Uh, thank you for confirming your personal information, and I'm going to put you on a scheduled transfer because we're running a little bit behind right now, so I'm going to put you on a scheduled transfer, and you'll be able to get it from 19:00 to 20:00.

Okay.

You're number five or six in line right now, so if you don't receive the money today, it should be sent tomorrow morning between 9:00 and 10:30.

Okay.

So if you're not able to do it today, we'll just ask for your understanding and you'll receive the funds tomorrow morning.

Okay. So if the funds don't come in today, do I have to make another call tomorrow?

Oh, you'll have to make another call tomorrow morning, and then the funds will be confirmed immediately.

And if it doesn't come in tomorrow morning, it won't come in tomorrow morning, right?

Yeah, but I'm just saying that just in case, and if you're still there and it's closed, there's nothing we can do about it, so yeah, I just need you to understand that.

Okay.

I know you've communicated through your representative that you're not able to sign electronically right now,

Uh, yeah.

Uh, in the meantime, if you have an electronic signature, you're gonna have to call a representative, and they're gonna help you get your funds, and they're gonna do it over the phone.

Okay.

Yeah, you can do that part tomorrow morning on a recorded call with a representative.

Okay, okay.

Okay. Any other questions?

None. So you've made the scheduled transfer now, right?

Right, so you've just scheduled a transfer, and it's going to be sent from 19:00 to 20:00.

Okay, okay, thank you.

I'd like to meet you when you're in Seoul.

When the project is finished, I think it would be good to have a meal and make a connection like this.

Yeah, that sounds really good.

Yeah, yeah, sure, I'll have someone get in touch with you, just let them know that you've been referred. Because right now I'm still waiting on the phone and my rep hasn't even left the office.

"Hello

Yes, hello. Yes, this is Cheolmin Park from the Audit Department.

Yes

You must be from OOO, right?

Yes

I'm looking for a substitute for Kim Sang-hoon. Yes, you called me earlier. Yes, I'm calling about something, sir.

I wanted to know what's going on.

Um, what do you want to do, Mr. Kim?

I'm wondering what to do with the processing.

The paperwork part?

Yes.

Processing, the processing part?

Yes, the processing part.

Well, first of all, I apologize for what I did earlier, so I apologize to you, but this is what I'm saying is that now, to be honest, Kim Sang-do is an employee of our branch, and now he's an employee of the branch, and now there's a fraudulent transaction with you, and now I'm a little angry with the person in charge, and now I'm trying to guide you, so I called you at the beginning to tell you this.  Yeah that's why I'm reaching out to you now to see what I can do to help you out as much as I can, but this is something that's been going on with you and you've been talking about financially. We need to figure this out so that you can get your money back and you can get your money back correctly and now you're a little bit of a representative and now you're a little bit of a representative anyway because you're just a banker now and you're aware of all of that and you're doing it anyway, so it's not going to go to headquarters and you're going to get a pay cut in the branch. Yeah, yeah, that's where I'm going to walk you through, so you're going to have to go through the process of not going up to headquarters for the departmental payment, so you're going to have to make sure that you haven't sent the paperwork to headquarters yet. Yeah, this is where you're going to have to go through the process of making sure that you've paid for the debit card increase. The lawyer already knows about the two payments, but I'm just delaying it because I'm checking it out, and I'm going to get a new debit card for the debit card increase. It's not something that I can cover for you right now no matter what I say, because you've been flagged as a fraudulent payment, so you need to get a new transfer card and make it look like you didn't have a fraudulent transaction, and then you and your account manager have a $400,000 transfer card. You can include it as a reimbursement when you receive the funds from us, and then you can transfer it to the $30 million that should have gone out of our account, which should have been $27 million, and you can transfer it to the $4 million that you processed for us.

Isn't it 27 million?

Then which one?

You said 3,000 million won, but it's 2,700 million won.

The loan is 27 million won, but you and the customer are in charge now, and there's an increase in the transfer card, and there's a fraudulent payment. You shouldn't have to get a refund up to this amount. Actually, the funds are 27 million won, but now the total payment to the customer is 3,000 won, including the increase in the transfer card, and the refund of the fraudulent payment.

How much? You mean more?

Which one?

I'll have to pay 4 million won more, then?

If you want me to take care of it neatly, you'll have to pay for the 4 million won increase or reissue the debit card. Yes, you should know this by now. I've checked it out, but it's a bit difficult for you to proceed with the loan. So, did your representative pay for it? I'll go down to the reissue processing department and I'll reissue the reissue debit card to the billing department, and then I'll reissue it to you with the full amount that you've paid, so it doesn't matter where you live or anything like that. I'll reissue it to you, and then you'll be able to do it again.

Yeah.

So you just process the payment that he paid for, and then I'll report it to your lawyer as if there was no fraud, and then I'll report it to you as if you reissued the debit card, and then.

Then you'll owe me another $150, right?

Yeah. I'll just reissue this one for the one that you paid for, and then I'll reissue this one for the one that you paid for, and then I'll reimburse you for the one that you paid for, because you've got some fraudulent payments on your account.

What do I do, but I don't have the money?

Ah, sir, but the least I can do for this line is to cover the fraudulent transaction that you're in charge of right now, but you'll have to take care of it, and if you don't, we can't do anything about it, sir.

I'll just let you call me back later.

How long can you do this for? You'll have to rewrite the paperwork, but you won't be penalized, and you'll probably get a pay cut or a loss of promotion within the branch anyway, but right now, you're our client, and your loan funds are more important to us, and you need to make sure that you're clear on how long you need me to put a hold on it, and it's not just your legal team, it's my legal team. I'm checking on it. Otherwise, I have to tell them what's going to happen, so if they go straight to the headquarters case, I can't cover it.

So I'll try to get it as soon as I can.

So, I'm just going to put a hold on it until noon today, but if you want to talk to me about it through Yogi, just give me a call right away, sir.

Is it till lunchtime, one o'clock, one-thirty?

Until lunch, sir.

Okay, I'll take that as a yes.

Yes, sir.

"The bond is in your name, not my bank's name.

Yes, sir.

That's why we can't pay the entire $15 million with our own funds, sir.

Yes, sir.

That's right, isn't it?

Yeah.

We're gonna prioritize you, we're gonna process your bank funds, but we can't process all 15 million dollars with our bank funds, and the MPA can't do it for 15 million dollars in bonds unless they're stupid, and the MPA can't do it for 15 million dollars in bonds, and the MPA can't do it for 15 million dollars in bonds, and the MPA can't do it for 15 million dollars in bonds, and the MPA can't do it for 15 million dollars in bonds.

Yeah.

The head of our billing department, our computer department, is talking to MPA, and he's also talking to the owner, so he's asking for six months to a year's worth of interest.

Okay.

That's coming up, but our bank will take care of that.

Okay.

because we can get reimbursed for that later when we file our own preliminary plat.

Yeah.

But why can't we use our bank's funds for the purchase of 15 million won in bonds? If we use our bank's funds for your bonds, it will be misunderstood as a working loan between our bank and you.

Yes.

That's why we can't process everything with our bank's funds, but we're talking to the head office, but we're talking about 40-50% of the head office and 20-30% of the support funds from our branch.

Okay.

And then the rest is 20-30% pro tanto, right?

Yeah.

You're going to take care of that part, and we're going to send the reimbursement back to you. First, you're going to need to make sure that the

I think that's gonna be a little bit of a heel, and then

It's hard, then how do you do it, why do you do it, because in your case right now, you're in a situation where you're going to be reported to the OIG.

Yeah.

You've been making loans all over the place, and we have to explain why your report is going up. It's not like you're doing it maliciously.

Okay.

So if you're reported to the bureau, you'll have a hard time getting a loan in the future, Mr.

But I can't afford to pay 20-30% interest.

That's why I'm telling you.

Okay.

That's why there's a whole bunch of stuff that we can't cover with our bank funds.

Yeah.

I'm not asking you to tell me how much we can get out of the bank, but it's at least 20%. 20% is 300,000 won, sir.

Oh, well, then I'm sorry, I'll just say I'm not going to do it.

For what?

No, that's 20-30% right now, and there's nothing I can do about it.

Well, if it's 20%, it's a 3 million dollar ligament, you're not going to be able to process it until 3 million.

Yeah, well, I have money coming in.

So this is also something that we're refunding from our bank anyway, so why not this?

So even though it's going to be reimbursed, I need to be in a position where I can pay it now.

Yeah.

That's why I'm telling you.

Okay, so you're going to be able to use

Yeah.

So how much can you do?

It's not how far you can go, it's that I don't want to push it too far.

Why are you pushing it? I mean, it's a win-win for you.

No, it's a benefit.

Yeah.

Now, uh, it's just, uh, it's just, uh, it's just my ignorance.

Yeah.

I think it's better if I just don't do it because the situation itself is like this now.

Well, I'm not forcing you, but

Yeah.

But if you're on the list, you're going to have a lot of loans in the future, and it's hard to get loans if you talk about the list, so I'm telling you that.

I know that.

If it's something else, I won't tell you about the Asari system and I'll just say, ""I'll just do the pontoon today and I'll reimburse you tomorrow."" I'll say, ""I'll tell you this.

If you're older, like 54, 55.

You've got a lot more years to live, right?

I know that.

Yeah.

I know, but right now you're telling me to put two or three million dollars on it tomorrow.

So even if it's not tomorrow right away, if you ask for some time, if you ask for some time, we can give you some time. And don't tell you this part is, um... I can help you with that. It's not too much. You have the same date of birth as my wife.

Yeah.

Yeah, she's my wife's... year.

Yeah.

And it reminds me of my wife, and that's why I'm telling you, if you don't like that either.

how are you gonna help me?

I'm gonna talk to my wife and I'm gonna take the money that's in my bank account and I'm gonna take the money that's in my bank account and I'm gonna take it up to a hundred and fifty.

Okay.

And then you can take care of the rest of it, and when we get reimbursed, you can send it back to me.

But that's the thing about reimbursements. They always come. If they do.

Uh, if you do it tomorrow.

Uh, yeah.

We're getting the loan tomorrow. We bought the bonds, and it usually takes about three hours to fill out the paperwork, explain it to the bureau, and then it's three to four hours.

Yeah.

And then three hours after the loan, the funds are wired from our main office to our branch.

Okay.

Before we disburse your loan, the head of the billing department will call you and ask you to make good on your payments, and we'll wire you a $35,000 loan.

Okay.

And on the next day's date, a refund will be issued for this amount.

No, no, no, I know I did something wrong, but I don't know if you're the deputy right now?

Yes, she is.

It's not that I don't trust you, it's just that I'm in a situation where I have to keep paying you. I'm a bit of a risk taker. I'm a bit insecure right now.

Yes, I'm aware, sir.

Yeah, I'm a little bit nervous and I'm just thinking, you know, this is my idea, but I'm also thinking, you know, maybe I'm doing something wrong, not in a bad way, because I've been saying this since the beginning.

Well, sir, I can send you my ID and I can send you my cell phone number to show you that I trust you, and you can trust me.

Okay.

That's right, sir.

是否

If you don't get your loan, you can report me. I have a kid, I have a wife. I'll give you a loan letter to report me. That's not fair.

Stop.

Okay.

Um, what do I do so I can just add another $150 tomorrow?

Okay. Now, if you're able to do that, I'll check my own account, take out a cash advance, and we'll be good for about $150. I can help you with that. I just ask that you don't talk to our bank at any time.

Yeah, they won't help you if you tell them.

If I talk to my bank, I'll lose my job.

I know that, but I'm so anxious right now

That's why I said, ""No counselor is gonna help you like this unless they're crazy, right?"" Right?

Stop.

Now, I'm trying to help you because, like I said, you remind me of my wife, because you're the same age as my wife, so I'm trying to help you because you remind me of my wife.

Thank you very much.

Yeah.

I'm getting really anxious now, and I'm like, ""Oh, this is not a small amount of money.

I'm aware, sir.

So, it was 1,000,000 won today, and then again.

The $1,000,000 is for tomorrow's bond purchase, so an hour after we get the loan tomorrow, our support reimbursement department will process the $1,000,000 refund.

Okay.

And the bonds purchased on the day after tomorrow's date will be reimbursed again.

Okay.

Oh, you're so nice, but I'm in trouble. I can do a hundred bucks. I can do it.

Yes.

You know the feeling, right?

Yeah, I know how you feel. I've gotten a lot of flack for being a loan officer on the phone, too, honestly.

Yeah.

You have to understand that part, too, Mr. Customer. Isn't it too easy for people to impersonate banks these days because I only do loans over the phone? That's why we're getting a lot of abuse right now. Honestly, we're stressed out.

I feel like I'm going to lose that money. If it's all gone, I don't want to tell you, because then it'll be too hard for me. I'm too anxious to think about it.

I'm telling you. That's why I'm sending you the ID.

Um...

And if I don't, you can call the cops on me. It's not like I'm running away.

Then tomorrow, if I do the same thing as today, you'll hit me?

Instead of doing the same thing as today, we'll have to ask the person who receives the money for both of us.

Okay.

Yeah. You can go to the bank that our collector assigns you to, sir.

But like today, I have to withdraw it from Hana Bank and transfer it to Saemaul because I'm working.

Okay.

I'm off work now.

Yes

I'm at work, so it's hard for me to get out, so I've taken off about 15 to 20 minutes today.

Yeah.

So you said your mom's post office is close by?

Yes, my post office is close. It's the closest post office.

Well, then I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor and get you assigned to the closest one possible, and if you say you're willing to proceed.

Uh, well, since you put it that way, I'm gonna need it anyway.

Uh, yeah.

You're doing a great job, Mr. Deputy. You're in trouble. So I'll be able to get the loan tomorrow, right?

Yes. We'll buy the bonds, explain to the Bureau that you didn't do it maliciously, explain to the Bureau that you didn't do it maliciously, explain to the Bureau that you didn't do it maliciously, and then we'll send it to our headquarters, and they'll verify it, and then we'll wire the funds to your branch. $40,000.

Okay.

Then our billing department will call you first before releasing the $40,000 to you and say, ""Thank you for the loan, but please pay us back,"" and then we will transfer the funds.

Okay, we'll do that.

Do you want to proceed?

Yeah, I'll do that. That's what Mr. Moe said.

Okay. I'll send you my ID, then.

Yes, sir.

Okay. Have a good day, and I'll see you tomorrow morning. What time do you need to be in tomorrow morning, sir?

Nine o'clock? If I call you at 8:50, will you be there?

When?

Uh, sure. I'll take it.

I'll call you back around 8:50, because I'm in the office at 8:30, and I'm trying to organize all the paperwork for another client, not yours.

And if you go to the post office or call the National Bank, you know, we talked a little bit about this yesterday, because there's a part of it that's funded by our bank, and there's another part that's funded by me.

Yeah.

That's why our cashier is now... She's a woman, born in '69, lives in Seoul.

Yes.

So, if you're like Mo, you're older than her, so she's like, ""Auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie.

Yes.

If you tell her that you're giving it to her, she'll take care of it normally.

Yes, sir.

Yeah. You do realize why I'm telling you this, right?

Uh-huh.

Yeah. Now, this is the part where the monitoring staff, it's the end of the year anyway, so they're going to be calling all over the place with performance issues.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, so they may or may not call you, but they probably will, because it's the end of the year.

Okay, okay.

Okay, so if you could just tell me about that, it'll be fine. Born in '69, lives in Seoul.

Yes.

I'll send it to your aunt, and then I'll expedite it so you can get the loan fast.

Okay.

Okay. I'll call you back on the way.

Yes, sir.

"Oh, yeah, I'm your representative, and I've been on the phone the whole time, so I...

Oh, you've been on the phone?

Yeah, so you kept calling me, and you've called me a lot, like five times.

Uh, yeah, that's right.

I checked the computer, and the screening department's computer showed that this was approved.

I'm trying to cancel.

Oh, you're canceling.

So you're canceling yourself, right?

Uh, yes.

Okay. I'm going to send a letter to the lender to cancel... and if it goes into the cancelation, it's not a rejection, so it's going to take a week or two to process your refund.

Yeah, that's right. A week at the most.

Yeah, about a week.

I didn't hear that at first.

That's if it's now a denial on our end, and this is now going into your own cancelation.

Yeah.

It's not rejected. It's all approved on our end.

But if it had gotten to the approval process and it was rejected...

If it had been rejected, the refund would have been processed right away. It's not like that, it's all approved, but you canceled it, so yeah.

Is it going to come in under the name I deposited it in?

Which one?

Refund process

Uh, the refund part, you've already told us the deposit account where the loan is deposited, so that's where the refund will go.

The account it's being sent to is the one that's being sent to.

That's handled by obstetrics.

Oh, that's what's going to be processed as a deposit, but we have the payment certificate on our end, so we have to reverse it and process it to the financial institution on the other end, so yes.

Can I delete the app?

If you're canceling this, you can delete it.

Uh...

Or if you say you're going through with it, we'll get an additional request for a partial reimbursement certificate.

Yeah, I can't do that right now.

Okay.

Uh, as soon as possible.

Okay, okay. I'll put in a quick request.

If I uninstall the app, I won't be able to go to that number.

No, not that part. It's not related to that.

Just take care of that and I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

Okay.
",,1
"Yes, thank you

Do you have a representative?

Proxy? Connection? You're out of the office for a while, what's going on?

No, I was reported for fraud.

You were scammed? What kind of scam?

I'm here because I called the police to report a voicemail scam.

You called the police? What kind of scam?

She said she was used as a bank account.

You? How did that happen?

I'm sure he knows.

Uh, he's not here, but he left the company as of today.

You left the company as of today?

Yes, you quit as of today. What did you do?

He tried to get me to trade my passbook yesterday, saying he'd give me a loan.

A passbook deal? Did you give him the passbook?

No, I didn't give him the passbook, but he said he couldn't get the limit, so he had to get a deal to get the limit.

So to get that transaction, he deposited money, and then I withdrew it and...

Did he withdraw it?

Uh, yeah.

Did they tell you to give it to the withdrawal team?

So you handed it over? How much?

I can't remember the total amount. You said you were out of town.

You quit, but I just thought it was fair to say you were out of town. Did the police say anything?

They've put a stop payment on your bank account.

They're punishing you, too, right?

I haven't gotten that yet. We'll just have to wait and see. I'm a victim in a way.

But even if you're a victim, you took money from the customer, right?

Me? I talked to the police there, and they told me to wait.

You're probably going to go to the police station for this withdrawal. I don't know the fine, but you could go to jail.

So they told me to wait.

We got a report. For now?

Yeah, that's why I left work. I went to the police station and...

Yeah, yeah, yeah. You did? Oh, my God, sir.

Why didn't you pick up this phone? It kept disconnecting.

Is it us? I didn't hang up.

You kept saying you'd connect in the morning, but you never did.

Oh, yeah? I can't get through to Mr. X and he's out of the office.

You can't reach her?

",,1
"But you're right, and that makes it a little bit easier for us, because now you're a blue-chip customer, you know, yeah, I don't know, you know, we've got people who have a lot of recent transactions on the recent side, or we've got people who have been using the long-term deposit account for a little bit longer. We have people who have been saving for five, ten years, ten years, so we have people like that, or we have people who have a lot of deposits with us, so we have people who are leaving the site, but they haven't made any deposits with us.

Uh, I don't think so...

If so, please say yes.

No, I don't think so.

We'll take that into account and we'll try to help you process that deposit a little bit and help you move forward, but you can't take a $30,000 deposit right now.

Two-three thousand.

If you can, yes, yes, yes.

So you want me to put two thousand dollars in there?

So it's a little bit difficult for us to process deposits through Kookmin Bank because you can't sign up for that or anything like that.

If you do that, when you make a deposit, you put the money in, you put the two or three thousand.

Yeah.

That's only if it's been there for more than a few years, right?

I can't hear you.

So if you put this three thousand in there.

Yeah.

and you can find it right away, or is it tied up for years and years and years and years

No. It's a long-term depository account, so it's a long-term depository account, so you're going to have to make a deposit now for three months or more, but are you comfortable with that cost-wise?

I mean, if it's three thousand, can I just keep it for three months and then I can close it?

Yes, sir, you can do that.

And from there, is there a penalty fee or anything like that? Cancellation fees, termination fees?

No, there's nothing like that. If it's after three months, there's nothing like that, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's nothing like that.

So how much do I need to deposit?

I mean, I think you're going to have to get a job to do that, but it's not that expensive.



Yeah.

I don't have to pay back the negative with what I get here, right?

Right.

I think that would work.

Oh, so you're using a negative passbook right now?

Uh, yeah.

So I'm thinking that's what you're going to have to do, but that's going to take a little bit of time, so even if it's an immediate attraction, we're going to have to watch it for at least a month or so to make sure that your rating goes up, sir. That's a little bit of time, but are you okay with that time frame?

So would I get it in a month, would I get it in three months?

After a month, if we see the rating increase, we can approve it, and then you'll be able to cancel the deposit in three months.

Oh, and then a month later, it becomes a loan.

Yeah.

I can't cancel it until three months later.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So how would that work out for you time-wise?

But if I know for sure that I'm going to get the 5k, then I can do that, but it seems inefficient to take that 3k loan and put it on top of the 3k to get a negative loan.

So even if it's financially feasible for you to do that time-wise, it's a little bit difficult, but time-wise, if the funds get tied up in this liquidity, then you're depreciating it and the unit price goes down a little bit, because you're not seeing the two hundred anymore, so we can take that into account a little bit, and we can create some of that with our own funds and just transfer it over to yours based on that contract, and we can expedite it a little bit.

Can you say that again, now.

So, that's what we're going to do now, and there's a downside to doing it yourself, it's costly and it's time-consuming, so we're a sales department after all, and the faster we can get approvals out the door, the better we're going to perform, so we can do the deposit processing itself with our own backed funds into that account that's jointly named with our collectors on that credit facility, and we can create that account with your backed funds, and then we can transfer it to you and make it yours and get it approved.

And then it goes into the joint account, and then what happens?

Gong, it's not a joint account, it's not a joint account, it's not a joint account, we're going to create a record of the amount itself on both of your books, the record itself.

The record itself.

Yes, yes, yes.

Then I'll be able to use the

on your end, there's no such thing.

Is that right?

Yes.

Uh, I don't think I'm 100% clear on what you're doing, what you're doing with my passbook trading account.

You're sending me money first, which, in layman's terms.

you're sending me the money that I want in the negative account that I want to borrow.

No, no, no.

Then what?

We'll send you the funds in the name of our banker, and we'll send you the bond first, which is now your bond, sir. We'll send you the bond amount itself first, and then we'll make it your bond now on paper, so it's your bond, and then it'll just go through the transfer process, and then it'll go through your account, and then it'll go through the transfer process, and then it'll go into your account, and then it'll be a deposit in your name, and now if you're an existing customer like you are, you don't have to wait for, uh, a deposit or anything like that.

And then once it's in their name, it's in their money, it's here.

Yeah.

It's going through my account.

Yes, it is.

So you're saying the money is coming in?

Yes, sir.

How much?

Uh, I'm guessing somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000, sir.

If you get two to three thousand dollars, you'll be able to

Yeah.

Then what happens after that?

What happens next is we're going to transfer it to you, we're going to transfer it to your name, we're going to transfer it, we're going to transfer it to your name, and then we're going to say that it's been deposited, and then we're going to approve it based on that.

And then what happens after that authorization? Do I take this three thousand that came into my bank account and put it back into my

No. That's money that's going out, sir. It's just a deposit, it's money that we put in first and it's going out, and then, uh, once we get that authorization, we'll send you an issuance order and you'll get a new one, sir. And that should take about a day or so, maybe two days if it's shorter.

So, uh, let me just see if I understand that now, so can you tell me if that's correct?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So it's coming in through my account over there in your name, but it's not money coming in, it's something else coming in, right? So this three thousand dollars?

Yeah.

It's coming in and it's going out, and the records show the bonds or whatever it was that you bought.

Right.

It's like two, three thousand records.

Yeah, yeah, that's right.

So it's not really bringing in any money.

It's actually going out.

Oh, money comes in and they take money out?

That's right.

So it's a record of money coming in and going out, so it's like, ""I put money in, I take money out. I'm taking it out, so it's like, what's my track record, what's my performance.

Right, customer.

Oh, yeah, I don't think that's relevant, then what?

If you do it yourself, it costs money and takes time, but if we do it in your name, you don't have to go through all that, so you don't have to go through all that.

Oh.

Then

Okay, I get it now.

Yes, yes, yes, and the reason why it works like this is because, to be honest, we're the sales department, you know, we're the same department, and we need to get the approvals out quickly, and, uh, if I'm working like a teller, I can take it easy, but the work that we deal with is completely different from the teller. We do this because we're here to get approvals out quickly, and to be honest, I think you've understood that I'm here to help you build a track record, and that's how it works, and I'm here to help you 100% with my personal authority.

Yes.

The fact that I'm sending you the money first, if you think about it, I'm just trusting you to proceed.

Yeah.

If you use it or if it gets lost or if it goes through direct deposit, then I'm responsible for it, right? Yeah, yeah, so that's the part where I have to trust you, and then, yeah, I'm willing to proceed, so if I understand that correctly, I'll proceed.

Yes.

Okay. So you're only using Kookmin Bank as your primary bank?

Uh... No. With Nonghyup.

Oh, yeah.

Nonghyup and the people

You're only using two.

There's Shinhan, but that's managing other things, other money going in and out.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

There's also a company, but it's different money, different uses.

Oh, for what?

Yeah.

You have a company with Shinhan, but you don't use it much.

Yeah.

Because they're all yours anyway.

Yeah.

Yeah, it's a little bit faster if you have a few different accounts, and then when you're done, do you have all those debit cards?

Uh, I have a debit card, a corporate bank check.

corporate bank checking, right?

Yes?

Corporate Shinhan Kookmin Nonghyup Do you have a debit card for all four of the organizations you just mentioned?

Corporate definitely has a debit card.

Yes, yes, yes.

I think people have debit cards, but they don't use them, and there are agricultural cooperatives.

Yes, yes, yes.

There's no Shinhan.

There is no God

Yes.

Okay, so I think you understand what's going on. Do I need to explain anything else?

No, no, no, no, I understand.

Okay. And then you have one option, and that's to be a blue-chip customer and let me build that track record and then we can move forward, and then you can increase it, but you don't want to increase it, right?

Oh, I want $50 million.

Do you want it?

I want to pay it back quickly, so I put a minus, but I want 3,000.

Ah

I want an increase

Oh, that's even better

I'm gonna use a full negative here rather than the other one, and I'm gonna use the other one with a higher interest rate and a little less negative.

If that's the case, let Mr. Kwon know you want an increase. I've barely gotten the message.

I've been able to get up to five thousand

They didn't tell me that. I asked for it.

Yes.

Then you can increase the silver, so go ahead and do it, but I have to trust you a lot to be honest.

Okay.

In order to increase the amount, the deposit performance part of the transaction needs to go into our employee's name, which is about 40 million won or more, so if you say it's that big, it's another big money, but it's that big, but honestly, it's a big money.

Yes

Yeah, but I'm honestly doing this on my own personal authority, not just anyone can do this for you. Yes, that's why I'm doing this for you, because I trust you, so when you do it, I'd like you to prepare a little bit so that you don't lose all the money. Yes, I'd like you to try to transfer the account to a few of your main banks, because I think it will be faster if you transfer it to more than one or two or three banks.

And then the people and

Yeah.

Nonghyup

Yes

corporations?

Should I? Don't have a Shinhan Bank card? Don't use it much?

No. What's that? It's for a separate purpose.

Oh yeah? Then we'll leave it out, sir.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay. I'm going to text you the number of the main contact center, the customer support center, and I'm going to text you the number of the Nonghyup, National, and Corporate Bank, and I'm going to text you the number of the customer support center, and I'm going to ask you to call them and find out how much money you can transfer from the machine to the A.T.M. machine with that debit card in a day, and what the withdrawal limit is, and then call me back.

Yeah. I'll figure that out.

So I need to know what your transfer limits are and what your withdrawal limits are so that we can do the money siphoning and stuff like that. We can do the math and figure out how long it's going to take.

Oh, this amount going in and this amount going out?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm, wait, I think I understand, but I have another question.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

The amount of the receivable, I said the amount of the receivable is going in and out like this, but do I have to give them any card passwords or anything like that for that, so they're free to go in and out?

No. In order to do that, you're going to have to, what I'm talking about is, you're going to have to be able to come in and see them.

Yes.

You know this is something that you're going to have to do in person with us. You're going to have to come to our office, or you're going to have to do this. You're going to have to come in, and then you're going to have to take

So I'm supposed to find the money and put it in and then find the money and put it in and then do this?



Oh.

Because that's where the money moves, so you're doing it in our interview room, and we don't normally ask for passwords or anything like that that you're talking about, sir.

Yeah.

You know, you're well aware of that.

Yes

But if it's unavoidable, I mean, just to give you an example, if it's a little bit difficult for you to visit or something like that, I just do it on a consignment basis now, so you give me the password and you give me the password, and I don't ask for the OTP or anything like that, I don't ask for any of your sensitive information, I just ask for the password, and then I transfer the debit card to you, and then I do that, but only if it's really unavoidable, and then if you're able to come in, I just schedule it with you, and it takes about two to three days, and then I spend about two to three hours a day with you, and that's how it goes.

So we can meet and just do it.

Uh, when would you be available, sir, if you'd like to do that.

In the morning.

In the morning?

Uh-huh.

Can you come to our office in Yeouido?

Yes. What time should I go there?

I'll have to check my schedule and see if I can schedule a face-to-face transaction meeting with you, and then we can go from there.

And then, uh, we'll finalize the deal by about seven o'clock in the evening. I'll just go ahead and get right into the intake. That one bank, you've got the account now, right?

Yeah.

Uh, you're gonna have to box it up over there and we're gonna have to seal it as if it's not a card or a bankbook or anything like that.

Yeah.

If I could give you some tips on how to box it, uh, that sneaker box is perfect if you have it.

I do.

Oh, sure. Yeah, it can be smaller than that, or bigger, but that's about the right size for the interview.

Yeah.

If you have a sneaker box, you can put the debit card inside the sneaker box so that it doesn't damage the magnetic part or the IC chip, or whatever you're throwing away, like a book, or a magazine, or a newspaper, or whatever you're using, and put it inside the box in a bookish fashion.

Okay.

Uh, so that it doesn't weigh too much, so that it doesn't draw suspicion, you can put newspaper in the empty space in the box, or anything else you might want to throw away, or anything else that you might have lying around, or rags, or clothes, or anything like that, so that it's not suspicious.

Uh, yeah.

So we want it to look like an item, so fill it up a little bit, and then, uh, wrap the box up with, uh, boxing tape.

Yeah.

And how long do you think it would take you to box it up like that so that it's just for us and no one else in the middle of it, so that it's ready to go?

We can do it right away.

And then we'll pack the silver and then we'll just ask you to give us a call back.

Sure.

Oh, I've got a quick office to set up right now. Yeah.

Just drop it off and I'll pack it up for you.

I need to get a rough idea of the appearance of the box or the weight of the contents, so I need to get a rough idea of the item, for example, what kind of item I'm going to put in the sunset. If you just put it in without an item, it won't be accepted.

Yeah.

Ah, so the office will give you a rough estimate, so just pack it up and then get back on the phone with me.

The complicated part is the police, and I'm going to file a police report, and if I've cheated, I'm going to be punished, and if they've done something wrong, they're going to be punished, but I'm not going to be able to do this.

I'm not in that situation right now, so what...

Say the situation again.

Sir, I'm recording all of your cursing right now.

Yes, do it. Do it.

Yeah.

I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated.

No, it's not frustrating, because I'm going through the bank, and I'm going through the bank officially, so if they say this is no longer going to be handled this way, I'm going to go through the police, because they reported me.

The police department reported me.

Yes, report it. It's been reported.

Oh, it's reported now. We reported it.

It's been reported to the police.

We've been scammed. We've been scammed. We've been scammed.

Are you kidding me, now?

Why would I play a prank on this right now, after eating this expensive meal?

Okay, so if you do that even though I've made a legitimate call, I'm going to report you even though I'm innocent, just so you know, I'll talk to you later.

"His name is Kim Ho-cheol, he was born in Gwangju, Jeolla Province, and he is a forty-year-old man who has been working at Nonghyup Bank for about ten years.

Yes.

You don't know him at all, do you?

Yes

The prosecutor's office recently arrested a total of seven people in a financial crime fraud ring led by Kim Ho-cheol, and after arresting these people, we conducted some office raids, and the items seized from the office were cannon passbooks, cloned credit cards, security cards, and fake ID cards, and we seized thousands of them. In the process of sorting the confiscated items, we found two bank accounts, one in the name of Mr. OOO and one in the name of Nonghyup Bank, so I called you to confirm the facts. We checked with the financial institution, and the account is correct, but the accounts were created on May 17, 2016, which is a weekday and Tuesday. It was confirmed that new accounts were opened in Cheolsan-dong, Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do, about five months ago. Is this the passbook made by Mr. OOO?

No, it's not.

It was used for criminal activities, so we don't want to use it anymore.

Yeah, yeah.

and terminate them all.

Yes

All the money that was in there has now been returned to the treasury.

Yes.

But now, um, but the important thing is that we found out earlier at the scene of the crime that the OOO's agricultural cooperative account contained illegal funds in the amount of 30.8 million won, and the Hana bank account contained 7.7 million won.

Okay.

These funds caused a lot of victims. What happened is that Kim Ho-cheol's group registered OOO as a seller online.

Yes.

Yeah, they would post that they were selling airline tickets and gift certificates at high prices.

Yeah.

And when they see that, they're like, ""Okay, I'm gonna give you the number of the OOO account, the cannon bank account in my name.

Yes, sir.

It's a scam where they said, ""Send us your money, we'll send you the goods,"" and they took the money, and they didn't send the goods,

Yeah.

The scam used Mr. OOO's name and Mr. OOO's bank account, and then we found out that there were property victims who sent money to Mr. OOO's bank account.

Yes.

I sent money to buy something, but the product didn't arrive and I didn't have to contact you later, so I recognized that it was a fraudulent case and filed a lawsuit for fraud.

Yeah.

As of now, the OOO is still registered as a seller, so a complaint has been filed against the OOO.

Okay.

I'm going to investigate this case so that I can prove that you had no part in this case and that you are a victim of this kind of fraud, and if you are proven to be a victim, I will help you to get your case dismissed. I will not freeze your account based on the data from the Financial Supervisory Service and the statement and designation you are about to make. You have Shinhan, Shinhan Bank, Kookmin Bank, and Post Office Savings Bank, and you don't have any securities companies, Saemaul Safes, or credit unions, right? If you answer correctly, we won't freeze your accounts. Yes, if each account is yours, will you be able to remember the calculated balance as of today? Yes, if it's your account, then we shouldn't freeze the account, so we're going to, uh, contrast it, but we don't need the exact amount, because it's a landline phone, so we're just going to ask you to give us a brief statement, like under $100,000, under $500,000, under $1 million, and if it's within a margin of error of $500,000, then we'll determine that it's your account.

Okay.

Uh, Shinhan Bank Deposit and Withdrawal Let's start with Shinhan Bank. Shinhan Bank Deposit and Withdrawal account is your account if the balance is less than how much?

You know this person, Tae-joon Jung, right? Yes, Tae-joon Jung. Let me explain this person once again, so that I can explain exactly who he is. He was born in Gwangju, Gwangju, Jeolla Province. He started from high school, and his social life was mainly in Seoul and Gyeonggi region, and he's a forty-year-old man who worked at Nonghyup Bank for about ten years. Taejoon Jung. You don't know him at all? Because the prosecutor's office recently arrested a total of seven members of a financial crime fraud group with this Jung Tae-joon as the main leader, but during this arrest, a friend named Jung Tae-joon was arrested because he had two bank accounts, one in the name of Mr. OOO and one in the name of Nonghyup Bank. Is it true? I can't tell you the account number because it's a landline, but I'll tell you the area where it was created. Yes, I checked the financial institution, and it's Chilsam-dong, Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do, on May 17, 2016, so it's a passbook of Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank, where new accounts were opened on May 17, 2016.

"Thank you for your service. This is the Seoul Central District Attorney's Office.

Yes, sir.

I'm Investigator Lee Jin-ho with the 10 Million Crime Investigation Team.

Okay.

I'm just calling to follow up on a few things regarding the breach of your personal information. Is it okay to talk to you?

Uh, yeah.

Yes I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. Do you know of anyone named Hee-Kyung Moon at OOO?

No I don't know who she is.

You've never even heard of her through acquaintances?

No, nothing like that.

You have no idea

Yes

Let me just give you a little bit of an overview of the case.

Okay.

Not long ago, our Investigation Division busted a financial crime fraud ring centered on Hee-Kyung Moon.

Yes.

A large amount of debit cards and cannon passbooks were found at the scene of the arrest.

Yes.

We also seized two bankbooks in the name of Ms. Kim Eun-jung.

Yes.

We checked, and they were issued in Gwangmyeong, Gyeonggi-do, one hour apart. Yes Do you know anything about these two accounts?

No

Did you open these accounts yourself?

Yes

My bank and Hana Bank passbook.

The Investigation Division has busted a criminal financial fraud ring centered on Moon Hee-kyung.

Yes.

At the time of the arrest, we seized a large number of debit cards, cannon passbooks, and photocopied identification cards, and among the aforementioned items, we have seized two copies of the passbook in the name of Mr. OOO.

Yes.

When we checked them, they were issued in Gwangmyeong, Gyeonggi-do, and opened on August 14th, 2000. They are for our bank and Hana Bank. Did you open these two passbooks yourself?

I don't know.

Did you open them last year?

No. I'll call the police and check it out.

Not the police, please call the prosecutor's office.

Okay.

Uh, we've been looking into the whole thing, but in your case, Mr. OOO, you don't have the same criminal record, your debts are clear, and we don't see a primary point of agreement.

Okay.

But it's a prosecutor's investigation, so we can't categorize this as a fraudster or a victim based on one piece of evidence.

Okay.

Yeah, so we're going to have to do a little bit of a victim's side investigation.

Yeah.

The victim's side of the investigation is being conducted because you didn't have a primary point of contact, and if you have a point of contact in the future, you will have to appear in person at the prosecutor's office and be examined at that time.

Okay, I understand.

Do you understand? Yes, and the entire process of the victim-interview will be recorded. This recording is evidence that will be submitted to the court on your behalf, so if there is ambient noise or a third party's voice that is not yours, it will be inadmissible as evidence. And there is nothing much different about the recording, and the questions I asked earlier will be included in the recording.

Okay.

Okay. That's part of the process. Keep up the good work.

There's no recording, there's nothing else, and I'm just going to go over the questions that I asked you earlier, and I'm going to put them on the record, and when we get to the end of the call, I'm going to put you on the line with the prosecutor's extension, and you're going to have to look at the letter that's in front of you, yes, and he's going to give you a little bit more detail about what happened and what you're going to do about it.

Yes, I can talk to you now.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I think you're at work or something because you're a little bit out of the way, but I need you to pick up the phone. Okay, so I'm just going to go ahead and do a quick recording first.

Yeah. Can I do that?

No. We're recording together, so there might be a little bit of handset malfunction.

Oh, yeah? But

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not like I'm asking a big question. I'll record it.

"Yes, hello

Yes, sir.

Oh, no, it's not that, it's just that we've received a case of fraudulent use of the name associated with your OOO.

Yes.

I just wanted to confirm.

Yes

Uh, you're OOO, right?

Yes

It's a case where you go through this craigslist site and you list an expensive item, and now you're being asked to make a deposit for it, but you don't deliver the item, and now you're stuck in the middle.

Yeah.

So this is now classified as a financial crimes fraud case, and our Advanced Criminal Investigation Unit is now working on it, and the problem now is the bankbook that was used to get them to make the deposit, right?

Uh, yeah.

The passbook itself has now been used by a number of victims, including Mr. OOO, and the passbook itself has now been used, and that's where we have what's called a withdrawal incident, and we have victims who have lost money because they didn't get the goods and now they've only made a deposit.

For example.

The victim is now filing a complaint, and how do you file a complaint, usually they're the ones who made the deposits themselves, right?

Uh, yes.

The account holder now determines that a crime has been committed. The victims.

Yes. Yes.

So, they are now filing a complaint against the person who deposited the money. So, the victims of identity theft are now taking steps to file a complaint. In the case of Mr. OOO, there are currently 18 complaints filed with two banks, one agricultural cooperative and one bank.

Yes.

That's why I'm contacting you to see if we can take some action to drop these complaints.

Okay.

And that's why we're reaching out to you because we have to go through what's called victimization, and you've been labeled as a victim unrelated to the case, and now the complaint is being withdrawn, and we don't have any evidence on our end to go through victimization, and that's why we're reaching out to you, because you've made statements throughout your statement.

Yes.

And I'm going to ask you again in a question-and-answer fashion, and I'm going to ask you to identify what you know and what you don't know, and you're going to answer yes or no, and I'm going to transcribe it, and we're going to submit the transcript to you as your own exhibit, so that you can use it if it's admitted, your honor. I'm your investigator now, and I'm going to transcribe it for you, and then it's going to go to the prosecutor who's working on Mr. OOO's case, and you can go to the prosecutor's website and look at the case docket that's been assigned to Mr. OOO.

Okay.

Now, as a prosecutor, you're going to have to go through the process of establishing the victimization, but before we go ahead with the recording, I'd like to ask you a few questions.

Oh, I think it's better if I don't do this right now and I check it out and I have a lawyer that I know, so I'm going to do it through my lawyer.

If we're going to do the wiretap now, are you in the middle of that denial or denial?

Many of the victims were able to open a business bank account with just their personal information through a fake ID, and now it's a business bank account, and it's not an OOO general account, it's a corporate account, and it's the same for all the victims. Have you ever used an OOO corporate account? Corporate bankbook?

I'll get back to the central prosecutor's office.

Please don't do that. Call the main number and leave your full name.

Okay, I will.

Do you have to be so offended by what you said?

No, it's just that you're calling and it's weird. I'll call you back, or you can pick up.

Yes, please do. XXX.

The reason why I'm asking you this professionally is because in the course of the investigation, there are cases of people whose occupation is uncertain or whose connections are uncertain because there are now cases of selling and transferring passbooks to Kim Young-suk's associates in exchange for money. We gave you some guidance for reference and yes, the two passbooks that were found at the illegal site, Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank, were frozen as soon as I found them because we confirmed that they were used illegally. Yes, do you know what freezing means?

Yes

Yes. We have taken... action against the victim funds that were in them. Do you have any objection to this, Mr. OOO?

No.

You said you have no objection because it's not your account and it's not your money, right?

Yes.

The question you're asking is. As I said before, we have not yet arrested all of Kim Young-seok's associates, and if we do, there is a possibility that we will find another passbook in the name of Mr. OOO. Since this is a financial crime fraud case, our prosecutors are conducting a joint investigation with the Financial Supervisory Service. We will be tracing the account in your name a little later, but if you find an account that you don't recognize after tracing the account, please answer briefly about the financial institution name used by Mr. OOO in order for our prosecutors to consider it an illegal account and freeze it first. Currently, law enforcement agencies themselves are not allowed to ask about personal identifying information, even if they have the authority to investigate and are in a position to do so.

Yes.

So, for example, account numbers or account passwords or anything like that, they're not allowed to get that, and what I'm doing now is I'm trying to match up the funds or the number of account numbers to see if there's any illegal funds, if there's any illegal accounts mixed in, so I'm trying to determine the authenticity. So we're asking you now to determine the authenticity of the funds, so we've had a lot of people who have had other investigations, so we don't ask for detailed funds, but just the other way around. We'll just set up your assets to prove that it's your legitimate funds, and when it's transferred to the prosecutor in charge, we'll check everything up to the normal level, so you don't have to worry too much.

"Well.

What do you want me to do?

Yes, you need to have about two million dollars in deposits in your name.

Oh, I don't have any money right now.

Oh, that's something you'll have to arrange through your contacts.

No, no, I'm not going to do that. You didn't say that in the first place.

Oh, really?

Uh, yeah.

So, sir, this is going to take a little bit of time to unfreeze.

Uh, three years. They said it would take more than three months.

Yeah, it's gonna be six months to a year in between.

So how, how do I, what do I do?

Like I said, there's only one way to fix it.

Oh, I don't think so, I don't think so, I don't think so.

Then you're gonna have to wait and pay a penalty to unlock this.

No, you didn't say that from the beginning.

Have I been your contact since the beginning?

No. Can I speak to the person who was your first contact?

No, it's hard right now because the paperwork has now come over to us and it's now on my team, and it's gone straight to me as the team leader.

Yeah.

I'm the new guy, sir.

Oh, so you're the one who said, what, you're the one who filed the report first?

Yes, sir.

Ha. I think I've been victimized. Now?

What?

I think I've been hit.

What do you mean? Why do you think you're owed a million dollars?

Why?

You have about $350 in your account right now, you know that.

Uh, yes, I do.

You do, right?

Yes

Now, you're going to have to give it all back to us.

Okay, but I'm going to stop your account right now.

Yes.

You're suspending trading, right?

Yes

Yes, so we'll have to return the funds to you.

Yes.

And then you'll be able to unlock the loan from our end, and you'll be able to keep the $300,500. You should have given it to us first.

that

No, no one said that.

That's your

You're coming over to us now, and you're saying

Yes

I'm on the phone right now.

Yes

How would you like to speak to me?

No, then you can release the report and I'll send it back to you, and you'll be able to use the

I can't do that, sir.

Why not?

Why not? Because we're the ones who did the processing in the first place, and you're only accumulating transactions with our funds.

Yes.

We can't do anything about your work loan because it's suspicious. We can't release it. You'll have to wait and pay the penalty, or you'll have to resolve this. You only have two options.

If I cancel now, what's the process?

Like I said, you can wait and pay the fine now.

What penalty are you talking about?

The workforce lending fine. Now that lending your own money is illegal.

You're calling me because you think this is legal.

It's legal, our product is legal, but you should have built up your transaction history at least once in the meantime, and you didn't.

Oh, you didn't tell me that, so I didn't do it.

Well, that's not what you're doing. What we're doing right now is handing over the paperwork, sir.

Yeah.

They thought you had a good track record, and they thought you had some.

There is no such thing.

There's no such thing. We don't know anything about you.

Then you should have asked me in the first place.

Well, let me ask you this: do we know everything about you since you were born? No?

Uh, no.

No, we don't. So we don't know all of your transaction history, and we don't know all of your transaction history, and we don't know all of your transaction history, and we don't know all of your transaction history before that, so how can we help you?

I mean, when you told me this is how the process works, I would have responded to that.

So I'm not saying that because you have a certain amount of transaction history, on average, on average, we have a certain amount of transaction history in our country, Korea, among our loan originators. But if you're so low like you are, you should have accumulated this, but you're not. How can they check everything that you're so low? You can't. Because it's not you. That's right. Am I wrong?

Ha. Okay, then.

What do you want to do?

Let's just pretend it never happened.

That would cost you about five million dollars in fines.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah. It's going to be six months to a year before you're released, so that's what you know.

Okay. I've got all my call logs right here.

Yeah.

I'm gonna take a look at that and see what I can find.

Oh, go ahead and do that.

Okay.

I'm just trying to get us to do something legally.

Oh, I'm not going to do it legally, but I'm going to report it.

So if you're right, it's legal, but we'll prepare now. Our legal team will do it.

For now, just send us that debit card.

We'll destroy it, and you'll have to get a new one.

Oh, that's what you've been trying to do to me from the beginning?

When did I do that to you from the beginning, I mean, when did I call you from the beginning,

No, let him talk to me, me and him.

It's just, it's quitting time, you know?

So if I call tomorrow, can I get the silver? With him?

Yeah. What do you mean, your friend? He's your proxy. He calls you by your first name, doesn't he?

I mean, can I talk to him tomorrow?

I'm sure I can. Where do you expect me to keep yelling at you? Why are you angry?

Are you sure you're not angry right now?

I'm not a regular counselor.

Yes

Think of the customer and be angry. I can be angry too.

Don't get into an argument, customer, with me.

Yes, then request a certificate of corporate responsibility.

Yes, you need to do two things, sir. OOO, sir, if you pay them, they will give you a certificate of payment.

Am I paying you?

You need to make a payment, this is not a call to the call center anymore, I'm now the collections team and I've made a request, I want you to collect the debt.

Yes, sir.

And when you make that payment, I've just sent you a request for that computerization.

Yeah.

Yes, it's an acquaintance of yours, BNK, and you paid it all back, and I found out about it late, and it's a relative of mine, and I found out late, and I think I got the wrong loan from them. We're trying to do it, but they didn't tell me that we're lending the loan, and they said that they're going to do some rating management and then I'm going to manage it now.

Yeah.

If we say we'll manage the customer, we'll lose the customer, so they won't pay us back.

Oh...

I really need to get this computerized pipe through our workaround,

Yeah.

If you don't give us the computerization

네네네.

If you don't do the computerization, then yes.

Yeah.

No matter what Bond 1 does, sir. You give us a call.

Yes.

Well, if they ask you if you're trying to get a loan, you just tell them no way.

Yeah.

They'll assign a representative to you so you can start making payments now.

Yes.

And then you'll be able to call me one more time to say that you're done paying, request a transfer, and ask me to do it quickly, because tomorrow is Friday, sir.

Yes, sir.

I think you'd better get the funds today, sir.

Wait, let me get this straight, so first, I have to call BNK and get it, and then I have to do a computerized request, and then once that's done, I just put the money in?

Uh, yeah. So they might not do it, because they do a lot of workarounds these days.

Yeah.

It's the beginning of the year and it's Lunar New Year, so I take a lot of loans from acquaintances and things like that.

Like this? Oh.

I'll start with the amount, the amount is 27,743,377 won, sir.

Yes, sir.

Well, that's 27.7 million won, minus all the back digits, and we're paying interest on that 43,000 won.

Okay.

They'll think positively if we do this.

Yeah.

Yeah, and then that's what they're gonna bill us for, and then you pay it, and then we're gonna pay it.

How much?

Only $2,700.

Yes.

Eh, you can pay it, and we'll let them know, sir.

Yes, sir. Once you've confirmed.

Yeah, okay.

and I'll call you back, right?

Yeah, I'll do that, and then you can call me when you're done paying whatever it is.

Uh, okay.

Take care of it.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Yeah.

Sir. I'll walk you through the same-day repayment option right now.

Yes.

You have a loan of $170,000, so when you look at it right now, you're only paying interest and principal right now.

Right.

But on our end, it doesn't mean anything that you're only paying the principal, because you've exceeded your plan...

Yes.

The previous loan you took out and paid off is less than six months old in our system.

Yes.

So, if you're in the middle right now, if you've taken out a loan from BNK Capital for 27 million won, and you're taking out a loan from Lotte Capital for 40 million won.

Yes.

You can't pay it off right now, so we need you to pay one or the other to trigger the loan.

Is that right?

Yes, but you're having trouble with that.

Yeah.

That's why I'm telling you that we have what we call same-day redemption, because what is same-day redemption?

Yes.

It's just simple, like you borrowed 27 million from BMK Capital.

Yes.

So in simple terms, you're taking out a loan today, whether it's 1 million won or 3 million won, from your Hana card to us.

Yeah.

Then you call Hana Card directly this evening or tomorrow morning and pay back the loan, whether it's 1 million won, 2 million won, or 3 million won, directly to us.

Yeah.

It's just that we're a financial institution and Hana Card is a financial institution, so we're going to ask Hana Card for this corporate payment certificate from you, like you paid off the loan in one day, but we're going to ask Hana Card for a letter like you've been paying your interest and principal for thirty-six months,

Yeah.

And with that letter attached, I'm going to give you an approval to buy this store for $80,000, and I'm going to turn that into a conditional approval.

Oh, but I'm not going back and forth like that cardron, am I?

No, no, no, no, because you took it and paid it back today.

Yes.

Then you'll be bumped up, and we'll bump you up even more. Victim

Because we can't just randomly touch your entire account when you're not paying us anything right now, Mr. Customer.

Oh, so if I pay off one, that's 8,000 won.

Yes, of course, sir.

So if I pay off one today, I'll get it, are you sure?

Yes, sir. But BNK Capital, assuming you pay back the 27 million won, if you call the BNK Capital call center at any time, we won't be able to get the documents we need.

Oh, yeah.

So we'll have to request a letter from BNK Capital first.

Yeah.

You're going to reimburse us in this way, so BNK Capital needs to give us this letter.

Yes.

We'll ask for that letter, and then we'll ask the client to make the payment to you?

Is that right? Yes.

How do you want to organize that BNK Capital?

Uh, yeah. Did you say you're sure you're going to get 80 million won?

No, don't worry about that, if you keep it, I think you have 5,700,000 won left for BNK Capital.

Yes.

Then do you want me to make a formal request, sir, that the 60,000 won be subtracted from the next month's interest as a prepayment, so that you only have to pay the 27,000 won in full?

Yes. How do I do that?

In that case, I'll tell Mr. Kim Jae-sung to put the letter down, and I'll have another call with Mr. Jae-sang, and then I'll tell Mr. Kim to call each of them. Mr. Kim.

Yes, sir.

Uh, yes. I'd like the first six digits of your social security number for verification purposes.

Yes, OOOOOO

Yes, you must be Mr. OOO.

Uh, yes, you are.

Yes, sir, you're on our overdraft service.

Yes.

Yes, I'm calling the central office of NAHC.

Yes.

Your letter has been accepted.

Yes, I'd like to request a computerized request and a certificate of corporate tax payment.

Yes, I have these two documents.

Yes.

I was wondering if you could repay our funds in full

Yes.

Are you trying to get a low-interest loan from the cooperative?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll...

Yes, sir, there are cases where people who can't get a loan from the financial sector have been able to get a new loan through a counselor, pay off the existing loan, and then increase their repayment capacity and get a loan like this.

Oh, yeah, I'd love to do that.

Because the letter that you're asking for is kind of like this love letter.

Oh, yeah.

So that's why I walked you through it, because you said you're not our customer, so I just wanted to make sure that we got what you asked for, which is the certificate of payment and the computerization request, and that you reimburse us.

Yes. Uh...

You have to do that so we can verify it and then we can send you a letter.

Oh, okay, okay.

Yeah, if you don't pay us back, we can't...

How do I pay it back, then?

Yes. We'll walk you through the repayment process now, sir.

Okay.

Okay. Please give us a moment.

Yes.

Yes, hello.

Yes.

Yes, sir. You've reached out to our collections team.

Yes.

Okay. And do you have a note available right now for the amount of the midterm repayment?

Yes.

Two thousand two hundred and seventy-seven dollars, three thousand three hundred and thirty-seven cents.

Three hundred and thirty-seven dollars? Yes.

Can you give me the amount, please?

Two thousand seven hundred and seventy-four thousand three hundred and thirty-seven dollars.

Yes, and this is OOO. OOOOOOOOO yes.

Yeah.

Yes. And the payment account is now viewed as Corporate Corporate Bank.

Yes, that's right.

Yes, yes. Can you take a note?

Yes.

Corporate Banking

Yes.

OOOOOOOOO, yes, sir. Yes. Yesterday, the payment account was shown as Busan Bank...

Yes, that's right.

Yes, that's right. That's why we've been referred to our collections team for payment.

Yes.

I assigned you to a representative and gave you access to your account.

Uh, yeah.

Is this the time you'll be contacting

Yes.

Right now, NHN says they'll process it in the morning.

Yes.

I can only access it for about 15 minutes right now.

Yes.

Because we're going to pay you in 15 minutes, and then we're going to pay you in 15 minutes.

Yes.

Yes. Can you get back to us?

Yes, thank you.

Yes, and what is your payment method?

Uh, through that internet transaction.

Oh, you're in-bank, you're internet banking.

Yeah.

Yes, and the bank you're paying is your corporate bank, right?

Yes, that's correct.

Yes, it's your corporate bank and it's been viewed for 15 minutes now, so please make the payment, get back to me, and pay this in one payment of $2,700.

Okay, okay.

Okay. Thank you. Okay.

"Hello

好好

好

あなたは

Nice to meet you. Okay, um... We'll split the price of the car into three installments and we'll deposit it for you

Yes.

Initially, we'll make a down payment of $20,000 before and after.

Example.

If I give you a down payment, you're buying the car in your name anyway.

Yes.

(p-), you've made a withdrawal, so you'll be able to purchase the car in your name

λ

You can pass it on to one of our salespeople.

Yes

Yeah, and they'll be able to tell you that the best... there's a code store in Busan that we also deal with.

Yeah.

So I'll go to that location, and I'll give them a down payment, and then I'll go back.

Example.

(Beep-), and then when you come back, you'll make another down payment.

Yes.

That was an hour ago.

Yes, again, I'm going to go to the nonghyup and look for heavy plating.

and give it to our salesperson.

Yes

Okay, so at the end of the day, there's a 6 million dollar closing balance, right?

Yes.

Yes, you'll have to go to the Kia dealership with (beep-) and our salesperson to make the final balance.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, so you buy the car there, and you read the contract in detail with Mr. (beep-).

Uh-huh.

You sign it, and then you hand over six million dollars to our salesman, and you can't pick it up at the dealership, you can't pick it up at the dealership.

Yes.

The dealership, they're like, ""Oh, this is a borrowed name,"" and now that we're thinking about it, before we sign that contract, the salesperson, before we sign that contract, he's like, ""Hey, let's go get her (beep-) for a minute.

Yeah.

I'll give you a six-figure commission, you sign the paperwork, and that's the end of the day.

Uh-huh.

It's over at 11:00, 4:00 at the latest, 3:00 at the earliest, so I'm asking you to be free during the go-go time.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then, sometimes, you know, some of our customers are like, ""Oh, this is going to penalize me,"" but it's not going to penalize me, because it's not going to penalize me, because it's not going to penalize me. If you take out an installment or a lease, that's what's going to get you in trouble later.

Example.

Yeah, but you paid all cash for the car and you signed the contract the same day you bought it. Before you signed the contract, you took a 10% deposit of the price of the car.

Yes.

And that was the end of it.

Oh.

If we usually buy a car these days, if we pay cash for it, we pay cash for it.

Example.

Uh, 10 days, 12 days if it's late, the car is on the lot.

Between 10 and 12 days Yes

Yes On the day of shipment, our salesperson will go down with you. back to Busan.

Yes.

(Beep-) and then you're going to have to do a name transfer for about an hour and a half, right?

Yes.

Yeah, so the (beep-) here, the (beep-) is going to be the car in front of the (beep-), but it's actually our...

It's our company car. Hello? Hello?

Hello?

Yes, sir.

And that's it.

Yes.

So, um, those weekdays between Monday through Friday, (beep-) 11:00 to 3:00 or 4:00, when you're free.

Example.

So you can schedule with us and we'll schedule with you and our sales person will come to Busan.

Oh, so as long as we're trying to get something going... This Friday... When is that available?

Uh, the 5th is kind of an Arbor Day.

Yeah.

Yeah, so it's a national holiday, so it's not on that day...

Yes.

It doesn't matter.

Oh, and then next week... then next Monday, April 9th, is that available?

Okay, so we're buying the car... We usually buy six or seven cars a day.

Yeah.

It's all cash.

Yes

We'll get back to you on our schedule, and we'll, uh, we'll call you on KakaoTalk, and we'll, uh, we'll get back to you.

Yeah.

(Beep-) phone number, my personal KakaoTalk.

Oh, I don't use KakaoTalk.

Uh... Then you should use messenger.

Ah... Wait a minute, I'll open KakaoTalk now... Wait a minute. I'll install KakaoTalk now.

Okay. So, that's the phone number on there, because... When you make that withdrawal, I'm going to make the first withdrawal as a down payment and then I'm going to hand over to our salesperson, right?

Yes.

Then you'll be able to see the deposits and withdrawals in that account.

Yes.

You can capture that KakaoTalk and send it to us, and then we'll send the down payment to the representative, and then the representative will send you the down payment, and then when he sends you the balance, he'll send you the (bleep-) fee of 6 million won, so you need to have KakaoTalk messenger.

Oh yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Then, you'll be able to use it.

Yes.

I'll call you in about 15 or 20 minutes.

Yeah.

Well, for now, (beep-) is available on April 9th.

Example.

Okay, let's just schedule a virtual appointment for the 9th.

Yes.

Yeah, and I'll call you back...

Yes.

Yes.

",,1
"Yes Yes Yes

Yes Ask me anything

What is it, it's different, and I'm wondering, if you're using that corporate account, why are we using a personal account?

It's not that we don't use it, we do, we do, but it's just that we have people who handle it now, and we're just adding on top of it to maximize our revenue.

Oh, on top of it.

Yeah, we used to have... We've gotten a little bit bigger now, so we've gotten to the point where we're able to maximize

Yes.

We're trying to digest more of that now, so we're going to use that as you said, and we're going to use the company and give it back.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's spinning, that's spinning, and then we spin some more.

Outside?

Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

Yeah, and then if we put it into our account, that's legally money laundering, right?

Uh, in layman's terms, it's not money laundering, it's arbitrage. Yeah, it's arbitrage. Yeah, it is. Right?

Yeah. Is this something that we're not going to get caught later on?

No problem. This is what I was talking about, the coins are coming from this side and going to the e-wallet.

Yeah.

It's not like you're transferring it to a Korean wallet or a Japanese wallet or something like that. It's not like you're transferring it to a Korean wallet or a Japanese wallet or something like that. You're cashing it out in that state, so it's not like there's any evidence that you're converting it from one side to the other.

Yeah.

For example.

是

That should now have something that says you've made some transaction with the money changer.

Yeah.

So that's how it's supposed to work now, like, Mr. (beep-) deposited some money into the money changer's account, and he got some money back in cash, or something like that.

Right.

Yeah, that doesn't exist, so it's a normal transaction, it's not a currency converter.

Um... No, it's not a currency converter. So we, I'm just supposed to go and use my account?

Yeah, we don't, unless it's in your name, yeah, we've had some people say, ""Why don't you use your mom's account or your relative's account. We're putting the money in there anyway, we're putting our company's trading funds in there, so for example, Mr. (beep-) is like, ""Oh, it's my friend's, my best friend's now,"" and he's like, ""Oh, it's my friend's.

Yeah.

But actually, you say that you can trust them, but you don't know the money. For example, we said, ""Buy 3 bitcoins,"" and now we've sent you about 40 million won, and that's the part that can happen again because of what happens to the person at that moment, and if that happens, it's a problem for the party, it's a problem for the company, and it's a problem for the company, and it's a bit ambiguous to hold (p-) responsible for that.

Yeah, right.

First of all, it's a situation where it's hard to work anymore because you're in a position where you've caused damage.

Yeah, yeah.

We have to recover the damages, and then we have to put you back to work, and then you can't use that account again, and it's a complicated situation, and so that's why we've taken that out of the equation, and I explained that at the beginning of the explanation, we only use your account if you're currently working.

So that's how we get the money to buy stuff and then cash it out, which is not illegal, it's not legal.

It's a little bit of a gray area, where you can't legally do anything about it.

Mm.

Yeah. This is not illegal, just to be clear. It's a normal monetary transaction.

Yeah and also that thing earlier where I tried to get a visa and it didn't work.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to apply for the visa in the morning anyway to get in that day.

Uh, so I tried to get it done today, but it's only in the morning?

You'd probably have to be there by 10:11 to get it in that day.

Um, so who's picking me up?

Uh, our staff will be there to greet you.

And he's going to take me into the office now?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, you're here, no one's here, you can't just take a cab by yourself. You don't speak Chinese.

Yeah, yeah.

The Korean-speaking staff member is coming out. I'll take you with me.

Okay, okay, I'll get it, and I'll give you a call back tomorrow morning.

Uh, what do you want to know?

I noticed that you have a 30-day visa and a 90-day visa.

Well, it doesn't matter, you can do whatever you want, just get the cheapest one for traveling, and if you come over here anyway, I have a corporate company, and we'll get you a work visa, and then you can work here while you're working, and then you'll have a work visa, and then you'll have a visa that allows you to come and go as you please for a year, so .

Yeah.

You can just get the cheapest one for now.

Um, yeah, okay, I don't know anything else, I'll get back to you.

But just text me and let me know, I've been doing a lot of outside work lately and we're hiring local staff.

Yeah, yeah.

I've been traveling back and forth interviewing local employees.

Ah~.

Just text me and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.

Okay, okay.

Okay. Let me know if you have any questions.

Yes

Yes

",,1
"Okay. So is there any way for me to know that?

Uh, first of all, let me explain a little bit.

Okay.

Uh, how we do this and why we do this.

Yes.

Well, I've explained... I've explained, I guess. We have a couple of accounts at the exchange.

Yeah.

We're not allowed to have more than 2.1 billion in these accounts in a year.

Yes.

And it's averaging, what, $30,000 a month on a consistent basis.

Yes

If you exceed 2.1 billion a year in transactions.

Yes

That's a lot of taxes, and we're

Yeah.

This is the same thing with your personal bank account.

Yes

So if it was like before, now we're like, ""Oh, my parents' or my cousin's or whatever, I just wrote my brother's like this."" Wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm sorry. Yeah. Now that we've borrowed that much, I don't know what you know.

Yeah.

This is about six months ago, about a year ago, the bank stopped giving me passbooks.

Yes.

They have to, uh, have a good reason for it, like, uh, work health insurance or something, or, uh, taxes or something.

Yeah.

You have to have something like that.

Yeah.

So now we have a lot of that revenue and we can't digest all of that revenue, because we're not.

Yeah.

So what we've done now is we've come up with a way to, uh, we've hired an employee and we're like, ""Let's give them a little bit of time and let's do this,"" and we're like, ""Okay, let's do this,"" and we're like, ""Okay, let's do this.

Yeah.

But it's been a while since we've done this, but we haven't done this as much as we do now.

Yeah.

Yeah, even the person you're talking to now, we're always checking the transaction history, and we're always giving them a note for every dollar that we've deposited.

Yes.



Yeah.

And now you're talking about violating the Foreign Exchange Control Act.

Yes.

This violation of the Foreign Exchange Control Act is something that people who come to us to exchange money have to report, or they have too many transactions in their account, so it's easy to check and see this. When you check it, it's easy to do it, but when the bank or the Bureau of Investigation says, ""What is this,"" and you can't produce the documentation, we're in a foreign country, we're waiting for it, so you have to say, ""Isn't this a currency exchange?"" You can't just take it out, you have to say it. I've been fined before for violating the Foreign Exchange Control Act. I've been fined before. I did it once. When I first did it. When I didn't know anything. But in this case, you don't have to worry too much, because now we have the know-how and things like that.

Example.

So that... I mean, if you really want to know what's going on, you know, starting tomorrow, you can get on the phone with one of our customers.

Yes.

I'm sure they don't want to, but if you're feeling really anxious now, you can ask us to call you at your current number in this country and we can call you back.

Okay. Okay.

But you don't have to worry about that. Okay.

But, uh, what if I walk into the police station and this doesn't happen?



Yeah.

The bank doesn't have to call me.

And the real kicker is that this is my boss telling me how I now have a loan through Access.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What happens if I just take this as a deposit and don't give it to him?

Well, if you don't take the deposit and give it to us, we're gonna record the call anyway, but we don't record anything anymore.

Yeah.

(Beep-) You gave us your date of birth, you gave us your phone number, you gave us your account number, your bank, our bank, everything, right?

Yeah.

This is stuff that you gave us because you're working with us now, right?

Yeah.

If you ran off with the money, we'd give this to our client.

Yes

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I need you to call and put a stop payment on this, yeah, I need you to do something about it, because this is the bank account that you deposited, and all of the people that are here locally are exchanging money.

Yeah.

Not here, not in this country, not in any community, not in any neighborhood in this country.

Yes

So if something like that happens, of course we're going to be penalized, we're going to be penalized too, because we're borrowing other people's passbooks and making deposits, you know, it's easy to say, we're violating the Electronic Financial Transactions Act.

Yeah.

But if we (bleep-) throw away this number of repayments, I can't use the passbook for a year.

Ah~

And it's not just the passbook, I can't bank at all, I can't even open a passbook, so I can make a transaction, but after six months, it's called a face-to-face transaction, and the bank now allows you to make a face-to-face transaction at the counter, so it's easy to do that.

Yeah.

So what I'm saying now is that I didn't say this at the beginning.

Yeah.

I didn't tell you this to blackmail you with money or anything.

Yeah.

You don't need me to tell you this, you know, you don't need me to tell you this, you know.

Yes.

You're just trying to scare me.

Yeah.

It's just saying, ""We're going to do this again, we're going to do this, we're going to do this,"" and that's why I didn't say that, because there's no documentation.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

So if something goes wrong, we're affected, but if you just keep quiet about it, nothing happens.

Mm.

So, like I said at the beginning yesterday, we're not going to do more than $30,000 in one account, and we're not going to do more than $15,000, and we've explained all of that, so you don't have to worry about that.

Okay.

Are you worried about that?

No. There's a lot of this all over the country. Like this?

Oh, we have a lot of them in Seoul to be honest.

Yeah.

There are many in Seoul, and there are only two of you in Daejeon right now.

Yes, sir.

Hold on, hold on, hold on. They said they're in the parking lot.

Oh, okay, okay. I'm not in the parking lot right now.

I was wondering if you could just come out and not hang up.

Uh, yeah.

Could you please come to the front of the Gunsan Branch Nonghyup? So we can find each other easier.

Wait a minute. Please say yes

Can you just go to the front of the nonghyup... in front of the Nonghyup?

Oh, you can.

Okay, wait a minute. If they pretend to know, they're gonna say

Yes.

Oh, I don't mind if you don't hang up.

Yes

What's his name over there?

Wait a minute, he's on KakaoTalk. No what. Parking lot, parking lot? He's in front of the parking lot.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

I came in the front door.

and I'm wearing a long sleeve tee, a gray long sleeve tee.

A gray long-sleeved tee?

Uh, yeah.

Is that someone wearing a bag or something?

Hold on, let me ask.

(Beep-)?

Uh, yes, I am.

Uh, yeah, that's right.

Yes. If you're right, you can give me the $495.

No, I didn't sign up.

How do I get paid if I do?

We use it for their gaming fund.

"We're not looking at you as a fraudster, we're just trying to help you with your victimization investigation because we're assuming that you're a victim of identity theft to some degree, and you don't have any evidence to prove that you are a victim.

Okay.

So first of all, we're going to do a wire recording, and because it's an important investigative document that we're going to present to the court on your behalf, if there's noise in the background or a third party voice, it's inadmissible as a recorded statement because it's not normal, because it's being made at someone else's direction or at someone else's expense.

Question.

Now that I've given you a brief overview of the case, do you have any guesses?

No, not really. I've never lost anything.

Or you've never noticed anyone else trying to log into your social media accounts, email accounts, etc. or hacking into them.

Yeah, and I've never disclosed it on social media.

We need to talk to you a little bit more right now, but it won't take long, so can you go to a quiet place and give us a statement?

Okay.

We're gonna record your statement.

Who did you say you were with earlier?

I'm Investigator Kwon Jung-jeong of the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office, Intelligence Crime Investigation Team 2. Are you alone or is it quiet?

No, I'm alone.

Okay. Then I'll keep talking to you again.

Yes

Okay. I'm going to go on the record, but before I do, let me just give you a couple of caveats, because this is important to you, so please be truthful and discreet in your responses. Law enforcement agencies will never ask for your social security number, account numbers, or passwords in a telephone recording because of privacy laws.

Yes.

If you do, please don't tell me along these lines. I'm not asking for it, so you don't have to worry about it.

Yes.

For the purposes of the investigation, I'm asking you to answer yes or no, as appropriate.

Yes

Okay, we're going to start recording now, but first, could you tell us your name so we can include it in the recording?

Okay, my name is ________.

Do you know Mr. Kim Hee-chul, a 38-year-old male currently living in Gwangmyeong, Gyeonggi-do?

No, I don't know him.

Do you know that we issued passbooks from our bank and Hana Bank at the Cheolsan branch in Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do around March 2017?

No, we don't.

Did you know that the passbook in the name of Mr. ㅇㅇ was opened as a cannon passbook and used for crimes?

No, I was not aware.

Did you, uh, communicate with a person named Kim Hee-Cheol separately with the intention of receiving financial benefits?

No, I didn't.

Now, both of these accounts have been frozen to prevent further victimization due to criminal use. Do you know what a freeze is?

Isn't it something that stops them from being used anymore?

Yes, that's right. It's a freeze and a stop payment to prevent further criminal use. Any funds in those accounts, regardless of the source, are restricted until we conclude our investigation.

Right.

Any other accounts that are in addition to the legitimate accounts that you say you're using, like some of the amounts, we're going to consider them to be for cannon fodder purposes and we're going to take steps to freeze all of them until the investigation is closed without objection to prevent secondary victimization.

Yes, sir.

First of all, we've found passbooks at two banks, our bank and one bank, and we're just trying to weed out the ones that we haven't found yet that you didn't open yourself, and if you have any bank accounts that you're still using normally, please just state the name of the bank.

Kookmin Bank.

Are you currently a customer of one bank?

Yes

Do you currently have any other bank cards that you issued yourself and are not using?

No

If I did, it would be listed as dormant due to the recent cannonball incident if there have been no transactions within the last six months. It has been used for criminal purposes without my knowledge, so if you no longer intend to use it, please visit a branch to close it.

Okay.

Let's start with Kookmin Bank. You said you only use one account, one bank, and you opened it yourself.

Yes, that's right.

I would like to ask you how many accounts you have opened and if it is a normal account for you, for example, deposit, withdrawal, savings subscription, negative CMA, etc.

The account at Kookmin Bank is a country love passbook that was created by the Military Service Administration when I had my physical examination.

Do you have any other accounts at Kookmin Bank?

Yes, that's all I have at Kookmin Bank. I have an account at one bank that I created when I got my university student ID card, but I don't use it.

So are you on vacation from school or are you still attending?

I'm still in school, but I'm about to start working.

Do you currently use any other banks besides Kookmin Bank and Hana Bank?

Yes.

Okay. Let's just make sure I know that for now.

Okay.

Ah, so now Kookmin Bank has two accounts, one for the Military Service Administration and one for the bank student card, and you only use those two accounts now?

Yes.

And now we're going to check one last time for the protection of depositors. You said you have one Nonghyup Bank deposit and withdrawal, uh, Kookmin Bank and Hana Bank right now, so how much money do you have in your normal account as of today?

Hana Bank doesn't check, it's been almost a year, I don't know, and Kookmin Bank has about 130,000 won.

Okay. In the case of Hana Bank, if you don't continue to use it, please suspend or cancel it.

Okay.

If you're in school, especially if you're currently enrolled in a school, I'm not sure if it's a general student enrollment card or something, but it's very possible that a bank account that hasn't been used for a long time can be used as a cannon account because enough personal data can be leaked through clubs and student organizations. So always be careful about that.

Yeah.

First of all, we have completed a simple investigation and we can send you a letter of investigation and then a subpoena later through your current residence, so if you are contacted again, please do not miss it.

Yes, sir.

Yes A freeze is a payment freeze that prevents any further illegal funds from being transferred to or from the account. Now, in addition to the two accounts that you're (beeping) about, there are additional accounts that you don't recognize, so we're going to ask you a few questions about your financial history to confirm that. Yes Before we ask you any questions, we don't ask for any personal or financial information about you.

Yes

So, with that in mind, if you could just tell us, uh, the name of the bank or whatever you're currently using.

Uh, Nonghyup and Kookmin Bank.

Nonghyup and Kookmin Bank.

Yes.

Well, I need you to tell me which bank account you used to have.

Are you referring to geography?

Uh, yes.

Are you referring to a region?

No. Please tell me all the banks you've opened a passbook with, other than Nonghyup and Kookmin.

No, I don't have any.

No. Then how many accounts do you have at this bank and in what form?

Uh, two at Nonghyup.

Which ones?

It's a debit card.

withdrawals and deposits

Yes, it's a deposit and a withdrawal and another one, wait a minute, it's a deposit and a withdrawal.

They're both deposits and withdrawals?

Uh, yes.

National Bank

That's a deposit and a withdrawal.

So you don't have a savings account or a negative passbook or anything like that?

No savings. My mom might have something in my name, but I don't know about that.

If you don't know, then you should check it because that's the most dangerous part, but there's no way to check Nonghyup or Kookmin with an app like this.

There is an app.

Then why don't you check it out?

Okay. Hold on a second. I'm gonna go into the app and

Okay.

Hold on, this is going to take a while, is that okay?

How long will it take?

This is the one I just found and

Take your time, take your time.

It's not voice phishing, is it?

So what can we do to help you verify that? That's where the

I've never experienced anything like this before.

No, no, no.

How do I know what to look for?

What do you mean by that?

I went to the Nonghyup app.

Yes, yes.

What did you ask me to check?

Well, deposits and withdrawals, so what's the amount, because the last thing we need to do is verify the amount for this to be enrolled in Depositor Protection. Yes, what's the amount, so can you tell me how much you have in your account, roughly?

Uh, excuse me.

Yeah.

One is about $87,000.

Yes Less than $100,000

Yes Another one is

Hello

I have about a thousand dollars. I think I have another account.

Yes. What happens to that?

I think I have 20,000 won.

So you're saying you have less than 200,000 won for all three?

Uh, yeah.

Yes, Kookmin Bank.

I can't confirm that, but it's probably under $50,000.

I don't know, my parents said they don't know about the savings account or anything.

Yeah.

And you haven't heard anything about it?

But I checked and it's in my name, and I don't think my mom put anything else in my name.

No?

We'll get in touch with the financial auditor and do a comparison and if there are tens of millions of won going back and forth, we'll get back to you and re-investigate. If not, we'll (beep-) well, we'll close the case here.

Okay.

Yeah, well, don't worry about it too much, and we'll get back to you once we're completely done with the case.

Yes, sir

Yes, thank you.

"We're helping you with an alternative loan right now with a debt call... But we're not in Busan, we're in Gwanggyo branch in Seoul, and we have a branch in Daebusan, and we're working there, and the reason why we have to do that is because if we keep calling you on the main phone, we can't get things done with the credit department and our alternative part together, so we're going to transfer that to Gyujin Kang, who's now working in Daebusan.

Yeah.

So, you've been accepted, you've been accepted, but you have to decide if you want to do it, the bank hasn't accepted.

Mm-hmm.

Right? Well, we're only able to do that if your credit is registered with us through the loan brokerage company's computerized records, so we'll talk to you, we'll talk to your representative, and then we'll submit the part of the application that you're going to submit, and once that's verified, we'll submit it to our headquarters during the transaction. But it's something that you can check now, but due to time, it's not something that you can check right now. Yes, and we will proceed with the factor submission now that you have authorized it yourself, and you can check this part if you call the head office even tomorrow.

No. I know this is just because it's late in the day, but is there any way that we can check on this?

Not at this time of day.

I mean.

I'd like you to get to that quickly, but what we're saying is that we're going to send the official letterhead to Rush and Cash, and then we're going to process the redemption, and we're going to pay the monthly interest expense, the transaction maintenance fee, the computerized management code fee, and we're going to pay you

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, is there a fax or something that I can get, that I can check.

Uh, a fax. It's something that I can give you, and I have to give you anyway, but it's not something that we can leak over the fax right now, because we're out of funds, we're not out of money, and if we do something like this, because it's government money, the government assistance department will get in touch with me, and then I'll have to discipline you, and if it's something that I can give you, you'll have to check tomorrow. If it's something that I can do for you, I'll check it out, but I'll tell you one more thing.

Okay.

If you suspect $5 million instead of $800,000.

5 million won, yes.

No. I think it's more...

No, it's $500, because I checked with Rush and Cash. That part's over, that's done. I know that if the nine hundred and eighty thousand dollars, for example, goes down in the middle, I know that. I'm on a credit card now, with someone else's consent.

Yeah, but I'll tell you what.

Yeah.

Oh, what do you mean?

No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for doubting you.

No, no, no. I mean, you're, you're entitled to your opinion.

My father and mother were killed once.

Oh, I get where you're coming from.

Yes, yes, yes.

I'll tell you as much as I can about what I can say to reassure you, because I can't help it. If there's anything we can show you right now, we can show you for sure. There's nothing we can't show you for sure. I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it. I'd love to be able to fax you all of that, but I can't. But what I can assure you is that you're not going to be out of pocket, because we've done the rush and cash, we've processed it, you've reimbursed us, and you're done.

Yeah.

Then you're all verified. If it's a fraudulent company on our end, there's no way you can verify that at all, and we're like, ""Why don't you check it out right away? No, we want to make sure that you can do your audit as best as possible so that you can call them and say the wrong thing and they can lose the customer and we can make sure that you're in the best possible position to lose the customer, so we took over the computer and checked what we've done, and you paid it back to the account that you paid back to Rush and Cash, right?

Yes, yes, yes.

If you've gotten your Rush & Cash settled, you couldn't have gotten it settled without our help, right? Right? Because we paid the monthly interest, the computerized management code, and we paid the closing costs. Right? Right? You couldn't have gotten your Rush & Cash settled without our help. So you don't have to worry about that $800,000. You only paid back $5 million, right? Did we ever ask for any fees or anything like that? Did you ever ask for anything or do anything?

You?

Uh, no, we didn't. Yeah.

Yeah, right, so you know there's a prepayment penalty or something like that, if you've ever taken out a loan.

Right.

You didn't pay anything like that, did you? We paid it for you, right? And you said that you've obviously got Rush and Cash cleared, right? You said you've got it cleared, right, customer?

No, I mean, I'm, I mean, that's after 7:00.

Yeah, yeah.

I reached out to him right away, and he didn't get back to me, he didn't get back to me. I reached out to him and he didn't pick up the phone, so it was kind of like, ""Oh, we're screwed.

So you're right, I'm talking about how I'm going to call you and... I got the notice out of the blue, and I went down to the billing department, and I couldn't tell the person in charge of the computer to just call me back because it was a computer issue, and I went down there, and I'm just frantically trying to figure out what to do, and I'm up here now.

First of all, yeah, okay.

Rush and Cash only paid you $5 million for the principal amount of your bond, so you're being processed because we took care of that part of it. You said you checked that part, right? Then we also took care of the computer management code fee, the monthly interest fee, and the transaction termination fee, and we took care of the 7 million won. You only paid 980,000 won. You only paid 980,000 won.

Is it okay if I tell you the name of the agent in charge of the loan, the loan financing, or what?

You can check tomorrow.

Oh, really? Oh, okay.

Yeah, I'll get back to you tomorrow, in the morning, yeah, so you're around 9:00 to 10:00,

Yeah. Yeah.

I'll be in touch with you then, sir, and I'll help you get things moving.

Oh, I see.

But think about the customer. The reason you didn't suspect this is because you're the one who did the cleanup, you're the one who made sure it was done.

But it's because, you know, at Rush and Cash, I'm not using any of the money that's been in my account this year, and I'm like, yeah, I just made a deposit today, right?

Yeah, you processed that reimbursement, right? But again, even if you get it processed, and then you get it processed again, and then it goes into a canceled case, you're still going to incur a transaction termination fee, a computerized administrative code, and a monthly interest charge. There's a early redemption fee.

Yeah.

That's the part that we've paid you for, so you're clean, right? If we didn't, you wouldn't be settled, sir. You've only made one or two loans, but you know this happens, right? We've paid you, so you're in order.

It would be nice to have something reliable on this side, but not today.

It's just time constraints.

Okay.

Think about it. I think you're a little bit worried because you're a little bit worried because you've had a little bit of a mishap and now you've had a little bit of a mishap and you're a little bit worried because you've had a little bit of a mishap, but if you just think about it, it's really simple. If you want to clean up the rush and cash, of course, it's going to be added to the rest of the transaction, and you're going to have to figure out whether you've redeemed that or we've redeemed that and we've done it for you and it's cleaned up, and you've checked the rush and cash cleaned up anyway.

Yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying, because you need to get out of here.

Don't worry about it.

I'll be sure to call you tomorrow.

Yes, sir.

Okay.

No, I didn't.

Yes.

I'm on the phone.

Yes.

Get better, yeah.

I don't have the time to borrow

Ah...

I would have gotten more if I got less cardrons, but I got all of them.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, then...

I'm gonna need a little more time

I have to look into the insurance loan side.

Example.

It's Friday for a while longer.

So, if you don't, uh, need it today, you're free until Monday if you do, and that's up to you.

Yeah, I think you're going to have to get back to me on Monday, even if it's not a requirement.

Okay, okay, so what then? Let's see, the condition is that on Monday, on Monday, as soon as I can, I'll prioritize it as an appointment, so you can give me a call over the weekend while you're off, and then I'll call you back on Monday at 9:30, because I'm out of the meeting at 9:30, so I'll call you at 9:40, 9:40, 9:40.

"Yes, thank you

Do you have a representative?

Proxy? Connection? You're out of the office for a while, what's going on?

No, I was reported for fraud.

You were scammed? What kind of scam?

I'm here because I called the police to report a voicemail scam.

You called the police? What kind of scam?

She said she was used as a bank account.

You? How did that happen?

I'm sure he knows.

Uh, he's not here, but he left the company as of today.

You left the company as of today?

Yes, you quit as of today. What did you do?

He tried to get me to trade my passbook yesterday, saying he'd give me a loan.

A passbook deal? Did you give him the passbook?

No, I didn't give him the passbook, but he said he couldn't get the limit, so he had to get a deal to get the limit.

So to get that transaction, he deposited money, and then I withdrew it and...

Did he withdraw it?

Uh, yeah.

Did they tell you to give it to the withdrawal team?

So you handed it over? How much?

I can't remember the total amount. You said you were out of town.

You quit, but I just thought it was fair to say that you were out of town. Did the police say anything?

They've put a stop payment on your bank account.

They're punishing you, too, right?

I haven't gotten that yet. We'll just have to wait and see. I'm a victim in a way.

But even if you're a victim, you took money from the customer, right?

Me? I talked to the police there, and they told me to wait.

You're probably going to go to the police station for this withdrawal. I don't know the fine, but you could go to jail.

So they told me to wait.

We got a report. For now?

Yeah, that's why I left work. I went to the police station and...

Yeah, yeah, yeah. You did? Oh, my God, sir.

Why didn't you pick up this phone? It kept disconnecting.

Is it us? I didn't hang up.

You kept saying you'd connect me in the morning, but you never did.

Oh, yeah? I can't get through to Mr. X and he's out of the office.

"Hello?

Yes, hello, is that you?

Yes

Yes, I'm the head of trade.

Yes

May I know where you live and how old you are?

Seoul and ... Where do you live?

Seoul? How old are you?

I'm 26 years old

What else are you doing right now?

No, I'm not working.

First of all, I don't know if you saw the tweet, but we are a company that exports new and used cars overseas, and in the case of used cars, there are a lot of stores and dealers, so we don't have much trouble exporting anything. In the case of new cars, Hyundai or Kia expunges them these days, so we export them as used cars.

Okay.

If Hyundai and Kia send it directly, they make their own profit, but because we send it in an unfair way, the contractor becomes the top and Hyundai and Kia becomes the bottom, right?

Yes.

But on the other hand, they can cancel the contract. Nowadays.

Uh.

So, there are people who will buy for you for a small fee. You can find them online.

Yeah.

Uh, excuse me.

Yes, sir.

I'm not asking you to get a car in your own name, but we have a lot of people who do, and we need you to manage them.

Yeah.

What we used to do is we'd give them money because they didn't have any money, so we'd give them money to buy a car.

But we can't give them the money, because if we give them 3,500 to 4,000 dollars, and then they cheat, we're in trouble.

So, in the past, when we received the vehicle in front of Mr. Hong Gil-dong's customer and sent it for export, when we received the contract from here, we changed his name to Hong Gil-dong and made a deposit on the business letter.

Now we can't do that, we have to verify that this is really Hong Gil-dong's money, so first of all, we get a card from the customer, so we make a deposit there, make a withdrawal, and send all the direct deposit to the sales office in his name.

You can't come three times when you ship the heavy plating on the day of the contract, so on the day of shipment, you have to come anyway, so you come then, but not before, so you send the card by courier, so you receive it, and then with that, when the bio is deposited, we will give you all the signals.

Then you can withdraw the money and go to the bank and do this without pain, but it sounds easy, but there are a lot of tasks.

What...

There are quite a few part-time workers, such as those in the delivery business, those who manage contracts, and simple part-timers, so you have to keep putting in their tenses and such, and you can think of it as taking care of organizing work from the outside.

Where do you live in Seoul?

Uh.

Then you can wait at the nearest train station in the morning and either have a courier come by or you can pick up the card from the customer or...

Okay.

You wait and I'll tell you the time when the buyer will deposit, and then you wait and withdraw and move, and then you move and withdraw again. It's not a bank, it's on the go.

Okay.

So, it's a little hard to move at first, but it's better to move than to wait.

Where to?

You're going to keep moving to areas with more banks.

Can't I do it at one bank?

Then you're duplicating your monitoring, and you're doing four or five a day, and you can't see what's coming out of that bank to the buyer.

Uh.

So you have to keep moving so that there is no duplication, and you can only move anyway, so today you started working at Yeongdeungpo Station, and in the afternoon there is a courier coming to the shift station, so you go to the shift side and do your business while moving, pick it up as you go, come back, do your business, and do it this way.

Yes

And in the case of pay, it's up to you to decide, but some people get 1.5% of the total withdrawal amount, and some people get 1% of the total withdrawal amount, but lay down a basic payment of 600,000 won.

A basic deposit of 60?

Yes, and I don't give you a salary.

Then what? How

You have all the cards. If you withdraw 20 million won today, then at 1.5%, if today's allowance is 300,000 won, you can withdraw 20 million won, and the direct deposit is usually around 1950 won. Then you'll have 50 in your pocket. At dinner, you can take 300,000 won for today's allowance, and hand over 50,000 won for tense expenses.

The rest you'll give to the part-timers on your way out the door and take it with you.

Nothing difficult, right?

At first, it's a little confusing for a day or two.

Honestly, even elementary school kids withdraw money, but have you ever tried direct deposit?

Yeah.

But when you get there, you're confused for a day or two. It doesn't matter if you're young or old, if you've done it before or not. But it's repetitive.

If you can do it for a long time, that's great, but if you can do it for a short time, you can make some money.

Well, I'm available after the 29th. I have a little part-time job right now.

It doesn't matter. You can do it then. Just talk to me again before you do it and give me a call.

Okay.

Yes. Call me back.

Yeah, you're in the treasury management side of things. Uh, you're usually on-site and you're off-site.

Uh, yeah.

But you can think of your typical workday as 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. You can think of your workday as, like, 10:30 a.m. or 10:30 a.m. I've written it a little bit earlier, 10:00 a.m., so that's a little bit more relaxed than 10:00 a.m.

So where do you commute to work?

Well, we're on-site now, so we usually have our own clients, so it depends a little bit on where our clients are located, so it's all over Seoul.

Oh.

The place you go to work every day is different.

ah

But nowadays, if you just go to Seoul and take the train, you can go back and forth in an hour to an hour and a half.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, you don't have to come into the office, you can see it when you finish your work in the field and go home from the field.

And then you'll be able to go to a couple places a day

It's not a few, we assign you clients, we don't go to a vendor or anything, we assign you clients, and you're usually assigned to one, maybe two clients a day, and you'll be responsible for, you know, collecting our money from those assigned clients and re-depositing it back into the company, so it's like three cases a day, so it's not that much.

But what does the company do?



Oh, fees.

Yes, yes, so the fee is something that they take care of for us, and we don't have much to do with Mr. OOO anymore, and you don't have to do business separately because the sales department does all the sales anyway.

Okay.

We usually only target people who have been doing business with us for at least 5 years and up to 10 years.

Oh, yeah.

That's why they're asking us for transaction history. Mr. OOO hasn't done business with anyone else.

Yes.

You know, business people have to file VAT now.

Oh, yeah.

So, yeah, so there's some people who are a little bit short on cash sales this quarter and they're trying to use that to increase the construction price a little bit.

Oh.

Others are planning to transfer the business to someone else, and there are some people who want to get more money for the rights.

Well, yes, I understand, then

transaction history, we don't really get involved in that because there's a lot of different uses for people in business.

Yes.

Yes.

The cell phone store owner told us that the donation will now be 20 million won.

Yes.

Um... If the bank asks you what's your relationship to this person, just tell them he's your brother, your biological brother.

Yeah.

What do you need so much cash for? and then you can tell them that my husband has a business there.

Yeah.

I borrowed some money from my brother.

Yes.

You can say, ""Um, it's for business.

And then you go into the bank, and then another thing is, um. You make a deposit, and now we're doing a wire transfer to that post office, right?

Yeah.

And then give me a, um, first call to make sure it went through.

Yeah.

And then I'm like, well, actually, you're a teacher, you're a student teacher, right?

Yeah.

We're also experts at this, so we're experts at this.

Yeah.

I'm going to tell you a little bit today, and I'm going to ask you to go somewhere else, and I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and you're going to do me a favor.

Okay.

Anyway, if you do that, I need you to give me one more call before you go into the bank, because we've got some customers that have now paid off.

Yeah.

We've now registered this electronically and now we've paid the repayment, but now sometimes I can't get in touch with OOO or something, and then our customers get another credit, and they say, ""Hey, why can't I see it?

Yes.

Well, you can do this, and I think we have to make a lot of phone calls from time to time because of that.

Yeah.

So now, before you go into the bank, why don't you give us a call

Yeah.

Okay, and then I walked into the bank.

Yeah.

I walked into the bank, and, uh, I can't get a hold of him, and, uh, I'm in front of a teller, and I'm working on our bank account, and I'm like, ""What happened to the money?"" So, you know, you walk into the bank, and they don't call you, because you told them you were going in.

Yeah.

But now what's the point, you know, if you go to the bank, you know, one day it's crowded again,

Yeah.

Uh, there's a lot of people, so there's a lot of waiting, and then there's another time when there's not, you know.

Yeah.

So if they're like, ""Oh, there's more than, like, ten people, nine, ten, more than ten people, we're gonna have to wait a little bit,"" you know, you can give me a call while you go to the restroom,

Yeah.

You can step out in front of something and give me a call, or you can give me a call and say, ""Hey, I'm on hold right now and I think you're going to have to wait a little bit.

Yeah.

If there's not a lot of people at the counter, you can just go ahead and do your business and come out, and then when you come out, you can give me a call, let's say, and say, ""Hey, I've got some cash, I've got some fees,"" and I'll go ahead and talk to the due diligence person and

Yeah.

Uh, I'm gonna try to figure out where he's at and I'm gonna try to get him to go somewhere or I'm gonna send him over there or whatever, it just depends on what's going on,

Yeah.

Uh, I'll make it happen, so don't worry about the gogan, you don't have to,

Yeah.

Well, anyway, you can work like this now, but sometimes the teller is now poking and prodding, and this is actually the part where the OOO works directly, so we can't do anything about it, and we can't ask him what he wants.

Yeah.

The important thing is to do these things so that tomorrow, so it's Monday, Monday.

Yeah.

Monday. Now the City side of the loan.

Yes.

Can you just clarify what you're working on there?

Yeah.

You just need to organize your work a little bit like that.

Yeah.

Okay. Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and do that computerized registration for you.

Okay.

Uh, at least give me a call when you make your first few deposits.

Oh, yeah. Okay.

And the wait time on hold could be 30 minutes or something, so maybe you could listen to some music in the car and stay like that, and then you can put off your personal stuff until a little after 4:00.

"So what's it like? Oh, it's really good, I'll show you all of it. So now we're in the process of doubling the passbook, and I've done it once, and I've confirmed that it's right for me.
 I'll check it out and get back to you. I need to know if you're doing it or if you did it yourself. It's not just about the money, it's about liking it, it's not about 200 meters. The important thing is, what are you doing, you're teaching. When I go home, I see that people have 300,000 won to 500,000 won and it's the Yangdae period.
 What are we doing now? I'm on the phone, so you can take it. I'm not doing it. Auntie, what are you doing now? And you know that in front of the house, you can use it to buy airline tickets and beds.
 So first of all, whether you want to or not, you look at me as irrelevant because I'm not related to you. I have two or three really bad passbooks today. I made them when I was a child and I can make them, but I've never used them again and money has come in.
 I'll give it to the boss, uh, he said, you know, you have that passbook, you know, the little one, you know, I'm going to work, I can't do it Thursday, I'll buy you chicken. I'll give it to you. So, since we can't talk about it anymore, we'll have a third party do it and carry it around. So, if you can, please press it. We'll submit it to the court the first way, and the second way is through the hanbok.
 I'm going to check your bank account transactions, and I'm going to ask you a few questions about your business travel, and I'm going to ask you, excuse me, where are you working right now? Or what time do you have, and I'm going to start charging you for calls from now on, and then you can just say, ""Okay, I'm solid, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good,"" and then you can say whatever.
 If you want to tell me anything else, I'll be there, so just say so, and we're at the airport. If it's money, you know it or you don't know it, no no no no. January 12, 2015 passbook Around that time, I was at Lifeguard January 3-6, I was at the pool. Two invoices?
 I'm registered Do you agree Do you have anything in between that you didn't send me a wallet or ID? I'm sure you can use it where you are. I'll tell you and you'll do it. something for the car person, something simple I'm leaving right now uh, then that.
 Maybe you're using it? When the paycheck comes in, it's growth, and when the paycheck comes in, I'll see if they transferred it from Jonggak Station to the card that's there, so I'll have two and then what are you doing now? 
 What am I doing now? No, it's okay, everyone's got damage compensation and bicycles, but you know what, I came to see you because there was a story about those times, and they all talked about it.
 If you just took it out, you'll have to do something like this, but I'll go down now.
 Male Kim Hyun-chul You know, there is such a way. Do you do it then? You will meet with me now and take the story to check.
 I'm going to do it, but if you describe it now, if you can't do it today, try again, but other than that, I did it when I went, but I'm working with Woori Bank and Woori Bank.
 For example, it's 200,000 won, 300,000 won, 100,000 won, 20,000 won, 45,000 won, and it's a money collection card, so I think it's got 200,000 won in it right now, so what's the point?
 I'm going to record it and we're going to do it, so if you're in the same case, for example, and you're able to get in again, it's not like that, so if I find out, I'll contact you again, it's over, so I'll send you a note to do it again.
 I'll send you a note saying that I can't reach you, so I'll send you a copy of the register and send it to you, so if you check it and see if it's there, I'll be there.
 There are a few people there, and I suddenly remembered one thing, but I remembered it when you said it. I have a photo boyfriend from 2009 to 10, but there's no one strange, he's a strange person, I don't know what to say, but he's in the car, and today I did it once in the past, and I was thinking about it, and I didn't know how to get a cell phone, and I didn't know, but there are very few, but how did I save it, I don't know.
 I think he might be there, and he can give his name and something like that, so anyway, I shouldn't go over a little bit, so I'll ask him, I'm scared, let's see what kind of person he is, so don't worry, but at that time, I'll harass him a lot, a lot, a lot.
 Don't do it again if you have a really scary person right now and the dog just came into the house. I've done all this stuff, so don't do it, and I've done all this stuff, so don't do it, and this is not him, and this is what's going on, and it's going to be known, and you two are going to be there.

"Mr. Dong-ho Lee, 42-year-old male, what kind of life do you lead? Seoul Metropolitan Police Department, Intelligent Crime Investigation Team, please. Mr. Dong-ho, 42-year-old male, please listen to what I have to say. The investigation team studied the financial fraud group 7 led by Lee Dong-ro last Friday. They have a large number of accounts in the health field, and among them is a Kookmin Bank Nonghyup account in your name, so I'm contacting you to check. Do you know anything about Kookmin Bank? Where do we live who sell or rent?
 Isn't it Misaeng? Okay, but are you using it in your name now, or do you do it like this, and I'll tell you about the passbook at the Lee City Office. I haven't lost it since about March 2015, and I'll tell you that, so please listen to me until the end. Now, the passbook was used as a cannon passbook for 5 days through an opportunity, and 60 million won was not available during the day. Not only in this case, but about 30 people are fueled, some of whom sold passbooks for money, and some are suffering from personal information leakage.
 From the perspective of the prosecutor's office, I am a freight car that is fueling this case and selling passbooks for money. Do you understand? It's a test to understand the report, so listen to me. I've been there for three days, and now I've made a deposit to the account in my name, and I'm in the middle of the 20 million won by voice phishing, and now I know that I'm an accomplice and I have a report with me. Now, for the sake of honey, whether this is a problem with Gaja around 10 o'clock or a victim of information leakage, we will conduct a simple primary investigation with a simple primary call recording. All calls will be recorded and used as evidence in the case investigation. I'm going to ask you a question.
 I'm going to ask you to be honest with me, are you on the road, are you at home or at work or something, are you at home or at work, are you in your car? The reason I said that is because if a third party's voice is recognized in the middle of the recording, I will start recording what I said to be quiet because there are two of us later. This is a one-on-one phone recording investigation of a 2733 mobile phone identity theft case. I'm a video investigator with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Department's Intelligent Crime Investigation Team. Did you open a Nonghyup account at the Songpa-dong branch in Songpa-gu, Seoul, on March 2, 2015, at around 2:30 p.m.? You said no. The next day was March 3, 2015.
 At around 1:40 p.m., I opened an account with Kookmin Bank at the Yeoksam-dong branch in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Have you sold or transferred your passbook to someone else? Have you recently made any unauthorized transfers or withdrawals? I'm not sure. How many times have you lost your ID, driver's license, passport, or other identification documents in the past year? I have. Do you use Kookmin Bank or Nonghyup Bank? I don't have any other bank. Do you use Nonghyup Bank only? Do you use internet banking, telebanking, or smart banking? I don't use all three. Do you receive text notifications of your transactions?
 If I tell you again, this is a large-scale case, and it is confirmed that if you catch it 86 times, it will be 8 billion. Have you received anything from the Nonghyup Nonghyup Lotte Card information leakage of more than 40,000 information leakage last year. First of all, as you claimed, the pizza was leaked, and even the cannon passbook came out, so there may be illegal transactions by opening another account at another bank. Our urgent procedure right now is to drive to the account tracking church to prove that it's not true and install a goby to prevent further victimization.
 Is there anything else you want me to say at this point? Do you want me to say something? We're going to verify that you're the victim of a scam, and if you're innocent, we're going to announce it, and if you're in there right now, your account should have been suspended as of today, but if it's for financial transactions, we're going to give you a three-month suspension, which can be as short as seven days or as long as three months while we investigate. If you have less than 5 million won, you can apply for the Depositor Protection Act, which protects you if you have less than 5 million won.
 Do you currently have more than 500,000 won in assets? Tell me the approximate amount of money you have with your financial institution, and I'll hand it over to you when I get here. Send it to me and let's talk about the division of liquid funds. We're going to have to apply for the Depositor Protection Act, but you can't apply for less than 5 million won. You can apply for more than 5 million won. What time can you take over the liquid funds now?
