"I know your name. The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to have to check if you've ever seen any financial damage from a tin bank account.

Yeah.

In the second case, is it possible that you're going to transfer this money directly to another account to avoid investigation, for example, if you're going to have a tin account, and then you're going to have to do some research on the account, and you're going to think that you're going to be embarrassed and hurt if you're going to get a tin account all of a sudden. Just from our point of view, if I take it once to avoid tracking accounts, it might be a little bit more complicated. If there's an account.

Yeah, yeah.

So what's going on with the canned account, as I've actually explained, it doesn't matter how much this account is left over. I don't need money.

Yes. Yes.

I mean, if I'm going to check it out, I'm going to have to try and actually see if I can get as much money as I want. If you don't get the money you really want when you get out, you can actually say, hey, this is a tin account, and then you can take it away a little bit. Okay, so, uh, I think you should, uh, make a quick visit to the farmer's bank note directly now, but that's because I can't go and find some money.

Yeah, that's right.

It doesn't make any sense.

No, I think we should call tomorrow.

Tomorrow?

Yeah.

I'm supposed to be looking into you today, but I can't.

Oh, he's on his way to work.

Why don't you just talk to your boss and get out of here? Or if we're focused on doing that now that I've actually done some direct research on the financial sector, if you've done any damage, then I can't be responsible for what I'm doing. So how did I end up doing this research, and how did I find out I couldn't get the money back?

Yeah, yeah.

If you've done damage, and you've done research, and you've done damage to your financial damage, how can I be responsible for it? I can't give you my fortune. Yeah, I can't give you my money, and I'm the victim, and I can hurt myself, so if you can do it now, it's okay to talk to your boss for a second. I mean, you know, we didn't push ourselves to go to work, but once we got there, we had to go to work, and you had to go to work, and you had to go to work, and you had to go to work, and you had to go to work, and you didn't have to go to work, and you didn't have to go to work, and you didn't have to go to work, and you didn't have to go to work, and you didn't have to go to work, and you didn't have to do that. I told you before that if you can do it yourself, it would be good if you could do it by wire, but if you could, you could take the time to come up with a personal lawyer and come up and do it well.

Oh, my God.

Well, it's not easy for us to do this part of Goran now that we understand it, and we're also forced to do it as we do research. It's a little uncomfortable with that, so I think it's best to do as much as you can with your own consent.

Oh, I have to go to the bank. He's at home.

I can verify that, and I can say that, for example, I'm going to think of it this way. For example, I gave her an enema. And some of the people who were doing research on the bank notes were asking, Oh, there's something I'm asking you right now, how much money do you have here? For example, when I give you a bank account, and I give you a million dollar bank account, and now I have a lot of money in my bank account. Of course, they're talking to themselves as they see it. Oh, your bank account's worth a million dollars now. It's like saying, But it's just your number. For example, if I really need money and I can find it and I can't find it, it's a tin account, and it makes sense how much money I have. But when you think you didn't have a tin account, you're wrong.

So we're gonna have to take it all out?

Once you get paid, your account itself will be checked with the financial director in a moment. Because I'm going to have to track down how my name is stolen, so I'm going to take a quick look and I'm going to have my own funding.

Oh, you got to go with it.

Yeah, so there's a procedure that needs to be checked for canned accounts. If this process itself is now in progress, and it's not going to work, then how can we help you if I'm not a bank employee?

Oh, yeah.

Well, if I'm the manager, I'm going to check for myself, so I'm asking you to be legal because I'm not in the bank.

Uh-huh.

Now, if you can talk to your boss a little bit, but there's an emergency, so I'm going to have to go out there, and I don't think it's a good idea to move out and check it out the next week. Then you don't tell me what you want to do and what you want to do to your account.

Yeah, that's right.

That's why I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to pay the rest of the money.

I told him, and he went out to the bank.

Yes, it's not a good situation at all.

I'll talk to you. I'll be out of here for a second.

Can we get out of here for a second?

I think we should talk.

A story?

I need to talk to the boss so I can get out of here.

Yes, I am. So I'm going to start talking to you, and I'm going to tell you that the third person is not in a situation where you're looking at everyone, but if you're talking to them, they're going to tell you that I'm going to have to take care of the bank office for a while now, and you're going to have to worry about it, because you're not going to have to tell them that you've been tested, but you're going to have to have to worry about the time.

Yeah, yeah.

So once I've given him time and talked to his boss for a while, it's nothing. I think we should get a bag when we get to the ID or the memo.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, I'll take your own bag, and I'll ask you to do it. Yes, sir. I'll give you some time. Don't hang up on the phone, and you can talk to your boss about everything, and then you can talk to me right away.

Oh, hang on?

So I'm going to keep going.

Oh, yeah.

Yes, sir. Tell me right away when you get out.

Yeah.

Yes, sir.

Yeah.

Yeah. How did you do that?

I'm gonna change. It's a uniform. I think I'm gonna have to change my clothes and be a banker.

How do you use transportation for your transportation?

I can walk. I can walk.

How many times?

It'll take about 15 minutes.

Don't run away. I'm a little worried if the bank office employees are even a bad bank employee, but if you're going to be worried and ready, and you're going to be outside for a moment, you'll be able to talk to me right away.

Yes.

Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll wait a little longer.

Hello?

Yeah. (Beeps)

Yeah, I'm on my way. I'm on my way. I'm on my way. I'm on my way.

Oh, now we're going to move. And I told you before that move, but once you do it, you can not go to this bank and you can do it together, and now I'm going to do it in accordance with the financial director's instructions, so maybe a sudden situation is happening. And because of the fact that bad financial employees might be involved, once you've moved, and you've reached 100 or 200 meters before you've moved from a little bit of space, we've got to get to some point, and we're going to have to get to some point, and we're going to have to get to some point where we're going to get to some point where we're going to get to some point where we're going to get to some point where we're going to get to some place where we're going to get to some place where we're going to get to some place where we're going to get to some place where we're going to get to some place where we're going to get to be able to get to do a little bit of this, where we're going to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot of a lot of a little bit of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of different place, and a lot of a lot of a lot of different place, and a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of people, and a lot of people, and a lot of people, and a lot of people, and a lot of people, and a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of people, and a lot of people, and a lot of different place where we's, and a lot of different place where we's, and a lot of people are, and

Uh-huh.

So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to talk to you in a little bit more space.

Oh, yeah.

Yes, sir. I'm gonna need you to hold your phone in your pocket and move on.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Hello?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

We're almost there.

Oh, you're here. So don't listen to the Agricultural Bank. Yeah, but if you look around, is it on the bank notes? Archiving bank notes.

Yes, I do.

You don't even have to go far, do you?

Yeah, it's close.

Yes, sir. I've been talking about it for the financial director, and I'm really worried that I might have some bad bank employees in the farmer's bank notes. Because I'm going to make sure that CMA cards move from their agricultural bank notes to their bank notes.

Oh, yeah.

Don't you have money in the Bank of the Agronoms?

Yeah.

You have the money itself, you have the deposit, you have all the deposit money. It's time.

Yeah.

I'm gonna have to check to see if I'm a can or not.

Oh, yeah.

So even if you have a deposit, you're going to have to take all your money and apply it yourself, and in a moment, you're going to have to pay for it, and you're going to have to pay for it.

Do I have to do it?

I'm going to make another deposit in case the money is now legitimately transparent, and I'm going to give it back to you in case it's a deposit, and I'm going to give it back to the financial director.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

So now that I'm about to do something about it, I'm about to hurt my parents, don't think about it. And the important thing is, now you have to put in your application to get the deposit. There's no bank account, so when you go in, you get a re-repeat request, you get an application, and then you have all the money. All the money from the Agricultural Bank.

Yeah, yeah.

Use all your money to transfer money to the bank account. Premature fulcrum

The whole thing?

Let's do a full transfer with your bank account. The example of how the C.E. code was in the Bank of the Agrocs and how the C.M.E. code was in ancient times followed by the Second Bank is what I'm going to do, and I'm going to check out the canned account with the Grand Bank.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Yes, you understood.

Yeah, I get it.

And then when you enter the bank, now you have a bad bank employee.If you're in the future and you're being investigated, or you're being investigated by the police, you can just say no to that question.

Yeah, yeah.

And now you put all your money in the bank notes, and when you're done, you don't have to come out and talk to me in the bank notes.

Yeah, yeah.

If you've got a bad bank employee, you're going to be able to hibernate, so don't make any other phone calls, and when you're out doing your business, and you're moving to the Great Bank, please call me right away, and I'll call you back.

But first of all, you're going to get your bank account back, and then you're going to get it done, and then you're going to deposit it as the bank depositor?

That's right.

Yeah.

It's not too complicated, is it?

Yes.

Yes, sir. So I'm gonna hang up on you, but when you come over and you're moving to the cod bank, you can call me right this way.

Can I call you on this number?

Yes, I'd like you to call me right away with this number. Because they're rusting.

Yeah.

Mm-hmm. Okay. I'll be in touch. Yeah, yeah.

"I called you at 6 o'clock.

Yes, before that, I checked your receipt, the Minister of Justice, but it's the rest of the difference. I haven't checked the receipt yet, so I'm just opening it up and I'm waiting. Yeah, I'm just waiting as much as I can.

So, until today, is this really gonna be over once we know what's going on?

If you're fully informed, you'll be able to go in and get your funding, and you'll have no problem at all. Is it possible that in this case, the interest card would have delayed the loan a little bit?

Yeah.

And so, because you had your $23 million, because you didn't take it randomly anymore.

Can you text me?

Would it be okay if I did that?

I'm texting the account.

Okay, so once I check the receipts, put them in the finals, and I'll leave you a text for the client.

If you can sign an e-sign or not...

I'll sign it myself. I need you to help me.

I told you to sign it.

If it's hard to sign an e-sign, when you get that e-mail with an equal.

Yes.

Don't you get it for us now?

Yeah, they said they had to sign some e-sign when they got funding, but they didn't have a cell phone.

Yeah, he asked me to ask the substitute for it.

Can't you see the electronic signature?

Yeah, I just got an app. I'm not going over it.

If you'd like to register your client information, you'd have to sign an e-sign...

You put in some customer loans, and then you get something.

Excuse me.

Then I don't see it. That's it.

You should see it, but if it's not an e-sign, we're gonna need you to send the papers to us twice.

Oh, yes, sir. Then I'll wait.

What?

You said your money just got paid, so what kind of money did you get?

That's the money I have.

I explained it to the financial director, and he asked me to try to break up my money with the money that he had. How much did you try to lose?

I'm on my way. I have all the money.

You have money?

Yeah.

What money do you have?

It's from the Agronoms.

It's not pick-and-tempering, but it's a giant bank case, where we're going to try to make a move, and then we're going to move to the cod bank, and we're going to take this money out of the bank. I'm not talking about taking money directly from the Agricultural Bank.

It doesn't matter if I have it, does it?

I don't care, but why are you so attitudeful?

Can't you?

Can't we? Where is he at the station in his jurisdiction? Why are you acting like you're suddenly entering the bank? You're gonna do an investigation? Are you saying no now? What? You're worried? Don't you think? I'm telling you exactly.

No, I recorded it myself.

Yeah, yeah.

It has nothing to do with me, Mr. Pitt. You're threatening me for recording. Do you think you're going to be intimidated by the common people?

Oh, I pulled my money. Can't I?

If you're going to do what you want to do, go out and do your research.

And then I'll go back to it.

If you were going to take personal action yourself, would you just call me if I did?

I'll call the Seoul District Attorney's office and call you.

Oh, go ahead. I don't know if I'm going to ask you to do anything, but if you'll be able to confirm the phone call directly, I'll go into your arrest investigation. He knew and texted me, so hang up, you xxx.

Hello? Yes, it is, isn't it?

Yeah, that's right.

Hello, sir. Kim Gong is the chief of the modern Capitol final.

Hello.

Yes, yes. Hi. I've been calling you a little late for the transfer, but, uh, is there anything that doesn't bother you right now?

No, I was waiting.

Oh, you're waiting? I'd like to ask you to make a quick personal identification until the front of your birthday.

Yes, OOOOOOOOO

Do you use your cell phone in your own name?

Yeah.

You're using Elsie Uffler's cell phone, right?

Oh, yeah, that's right.

All right, we're just going to ask you to check your account number for us.

Four National Banks

Yes, OOO.

Yeah, that's right.

You set up an automatic transfer account for the same national bank account, and each month you assigned a payment for ten days, sir.

Yeah, that's right.

Okay, so our approval fund is $23 million. If you've applied eight points of interest, and you've got five years of payment, you've got forty-five and twenty-three cents, and now you've got a little extra. That's seven million won. You're the same as a gold-collar eight-year-old. Your payment, including your principal, is $550,778,850.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, that's not going to change. I've been guided. Yeah, sure. Uh, I'd like to thank you for your personal information. Now that we're a little bit late for the transfer, I'm going to hold you with a reservation card. You'll have time from 19 o'clock till 20 o'clock.

Yeah.

Your client's turn is now from 5th to 6th, and if you don't get your money from today, you'll be transferred from 9 a.m. to 10 half a.m. tomorrow.

Yeah.

And if you're going to say it's a little bit out of the way today, this is a small part of your budget tomorrow morning.

Yeah. If you don't get your money today, do you have to call me again tomorrow?

Oh, one more call from your supervisor in the morning. And then the money just went straight to it.

Well, if that's the case, there's no chance you won't come in tomorrow morning, right?

That's right. But if I'm telling you something in case you're prepared, and if you're left with employees, there's nothing you can do about it, so please excuse us for that part.

Yeah.

I've been told that you don't have an electronic signature right now.

Yeah.

Uh, in case of an electronic signature, I'm gonna call my supervisor, I'm gonna fund it, I'm gonna help you with the green phone.

Yeah.

Yeah, that part's on your phone tomorrow morning.

Yes, sir.

Do you have any other questions?

No, so we've got a reservation transfer right now. Right?

That's right. From now on, I've given you my reservation money. It's 19 o'clock until 20 o'clock.

Yes, sir. Thank you.

Your client, you've been through a lot. So I'm going to ask you to give me some comfort, and I'm going to ask you to help me.

I want you to meet me when you go to Seoul.

Oh, yeah? Well, if you're done with that, you might as well make a dinner for us.

Yeah, that's a great story.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna ask you to call my supervisor, tell him you've been guided. I'm still waiting for my supervisor and I don't go home.

Yes, sir.

Your client's been through a lot.

Yeah.

Hello. Yes, sir. Director Park Semmmin.

Yes.

Oh, you're a client, right?

Yes.

Oh, yeah, you're looking for a substitute, Kim Sang-hoon. Yeah, I had a call earlier. Yes, uh, you called for something, sir.

Oh, what do you want to be?

Well, how do you do something, Mr. Customer?

I don't know how to deal with it.

The paperwork?

Yes.

Parsing and processing?

Yes, it's the processing part.

Well, first of all, I'm kind of on my back, so I'm just giving you an apology, but this is for you. What I'm telling you is, to be honest, Kim Sang-soo is now an employee on our side. Now that he's working at the store and he's got a little bit of a dirty deal with his client, I'm kind of a little bit angry with him, and now I'm calling him at the beginning to tell him that I'm going to show him the way. Now, if you're honest with me about this, I'm not really worried about you, either. Now that we're working at our side, and we're in trouble, and now you're on loan money, and now, of course, you're on the line right now, and this part of the deal is important, and once it's on top of the original, we're losing our image. So now I've been trying to reach out to you in a way that I can help you with, but this is a little bit of a little bit of money and now you just keep talking to me. We're going to have to figure this out somehow, and you're going to get some money, and now you're going to get a little bit of money, and then you're just going to get a little bit of money, and you're just going to be a little bit of an employee, and you're just going to be a little bit of an employee, and you're just going to be a little bit of an employee, and you're not going to go up to the headquarters right now, you're not going to go up to the headquarters, you're going to get a little bit of it, you're going to get a little bit of it, you're going to get a little bit of it, you're going to be a little bit of it, you're going to get a little bit of it, you're going to get a little bit of it, you're going to get a little bit of it, you're going to get a little bit of money, and you's going to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of money, you's going, you's going, you's going to get a little bit of a little bit of money, you's going to get a little bit of money, and you's going to get a little bit of money, and you's going to get a little bit of money, you's going to get a little bit of money, you're going to get a little bit of money, and you're going to get a little bit of money, and then you're going to get a little bit of money, you's going, you're going to get a little bit of money, and you're going to get a little bit of money, you's going to get paid off, and you's going to get a little bit of money, and you's going to get a little bit of money, and you's going to get a little bit of money, and you's going to get a little bit of money, and you's going to get a little bit of money, and then you's going to get a little bit of money, and you's going to get a little bit of money, you's going to get a little bit of money, you's going Yeah, well, I'm going to give you a tour now, and if you're not going to go back to your headquarters with your report, you're not going to go through the paperwork. Well, this is where you're now adding a double card, and now you're paying me something. I mean, you know, the attorney's office already knows everything about the lead. But once I'm checking this out, I've put a table on it, and I'm getting a new paper for the extra part of the double card. Because you're up on the issue, this isn't what I'm going to cover for you right now, no matter how I say it. So this is why he's re-printed a double card, so he makes it a little bit clear that you didn't have a deal, and then you and your client and I have four million dollars that we've issued now. The point is, when you're in charge of our funds, you're going to have to add some money back, and now you're going to have to pay us $27 million, right?　You're going to have to go out for $27 million, and you're going to have to pay me for the $4 million loan you've been working on right now.

Two thousand seven hundred, isn’t it?

Then which one?

That's $3 million. That's $27 million.

You're paying for the $27 million loan, and you're paying for it, and you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it, you're paying for it. You're not going to have to get paid for this. In fact, the funds are $27 million to run at the time of the loan, and now they're paying you $3 million to get paid back the sum of your loan to the customer's interest card.

How much? You mean more?

Like what?

I have to pay another four million won. What then?

You know, if you want me to clean up a little bit, you're right to re-print a four-million-dollar double card. Yeah, this is where you know your customers now. I checked, sir, but it was hard for you to run this loan. Okay. You have a loan from your client, don't you? I just need you to deal with this. I'm going to go down to the re-printing department and re-print the re-print the transfer card, and then I'm going to re-print it with some full product, so there's nothing wrong with where you're staying or what you're doing. I'm going to give it back to my client.

Yeah.

I'll report it to the attorney for you, and then I'll give it to you as a re-printed foreign card.

So we're going to have to pay $1.50 more.

That's right. The person in charge has paid you to redistribute this, and your client's office, and you've got some intangible stuff. This is going to be for you.

I don't know what to do, but I don't have any money.

But if you don't, we can't fix anything.

I'll call you back later.

How long will this last? This one needs to re-write the paperwork, but he can't punish it, and he's gonna be in charge anyway, either with the seal or with the drop-off. But first of all, my client, my client, the loan money is more important. I'm sure you're going to have to tell the law department how long I'm going to have to hold you back, but I'm not going to tell the law department. I'm checking it out. Or I'm gonna have to tell you what's going to happen, so I can't do anything about this if the lawyer asks me to do it right away.

Then I'll try to save it as soon as I can.

Well, if you're gonna call me right away, sir, I'm just gonna have to put you up for 12 o'clock, and I'm gonna need you to call me right away.

It's been lunch at 1:00 or 1:30?

It's lunch time. It's 1:30 p.m.

Yes, sir. I'll see what I can do.

",0.840980649,1
"The bonds are named after you, not the bonds by the name of our bank.

Yeah.

It's just that we can't pay 15 million dollars for all our bank funds, sir.

Yeah.

You're right, aren't you?

Yeah.

We're making it our top priority to pay for the bank, but with our bank money, we can't handle all the $10 million, and with the MPA, they can't afford to buy $15 million, unless they're stupid.

Yeah.

I'm talking to the head of our managing department, and I'm talking to them, so they want me to pay from six months to up to a year's interest.

Yeah.

We're going to talk about that, but we're going to deal with it in the bank.

Yeah.

Because later on, we're going to have a little bit of imagination, and we're going to get all of that back.

Yeah.

But the part where we can't pay for all our bank funds for the 15 million dollar bond that we're buying is why, if we can't afford it, if we can afford it, we'll be mistaken for the bank's bank's bank's bank's bank's bank's bank's bank's bank's bank's client's loan.

Yeah.

That's why we can't deal with all of our bank funds, but we're talking about 40 to 50 percent of what we're doing right now, and we're going to do it with 20 to 30 percent of our funding money.

Yeah.

So the rest of the rain is pro-tage, 20 to 30 percent, right?

Yeah.

The client will take care of this, and we'll give them back to you. First of all,

I think it's a little hilly, then.

Well, then it's hard to figure out how to do that, and you're in a situation like your client, and you're in a situation where you're going to report to your bank account.

Yeah.

We're not gonna have to sign this report right now, because you're not maliciously doing that.

Yeah.

So if you get your tax returns, it's too hard for you to get a loan for the financial order.

But I can't afford 20 to 30 percent.

That's what I'm telling you.

Yeah.

That's why we can't deal with all of our bank funds.

Yeah.

I don't want to ask you to give me as much money as I can with my bank support as I can, but I'm going to have 20 percent, and 20 percent is $3 million, sir.

Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm just gonna pretend I'm not doing it.

What's the matter with you, sir?

No, that's 20 to 30 percent right now, and there's nothing I can do about that right now.

Well, if it's 20%, it means that the customer has not been able to handle up to three million people.

Yeah, well, I have money to go out with.

So we're just gonna take this out of our bank anyway, and this isn't gonna work?

I mean, I mean, I'm gonna have to be in a situation where I'm going to be able to pay for it.

Yeah.

That's why I'm telling you.

Okay, then, sir.

Yeah.

How much does your client have to do with that?

I don't want to overdo it. I don't want to overdo it.

Why do you do it? It's good for you when I see it.

No, it's a profit.

Yeah.

It's just that I don't know what happened today.

Yeah.

I think it's better if I don't do it right now.

Well, I don't have to, but...

Yeah.

I'm just saying, if you're going to be a depositor, you're going to have to ask your client... You're going to get a lot of loans in the future, but I'm telling you because when you hear about a very bad loan, it's hard to get a loan.

I know that.

I don't want to talk about the Appari Islands, but I'm just gonna take care of the school today and I'll pay you back tomorrow, and I'll say,

If you're 54,55, you're older.

You have more days to live now, don't you?

I know that.

Yeah.

I know, but right now, you're asking me to give you $2.3 million tomorrow.

So if you ask for some time, even if it isn't tomorrow, then you can give them some time. Sir, and don't tell me about this. I'm gonna help you. I don't give you too much time, so my wife and I are the same age.

Yeah.

My wife...She's a bitch.

Yeah.

And I think about my wife, and that's why I'm talking to her, and if you say no to that,

How do you say you're helping?

I'll talk to my wife, and I'll take the money from my mother's bank account, and I'll round it up, and I'll be able to round it up to a maximum of a hundred and fifty.

Yeah.

Then the rest of the clients will take care of it, and if they get back to us, they'll give it back to me.

But that's what it's always gonna be.

Well, if you're gonna take care of it tomorrow,

Yeah.

It usually takes about three hours for us to buy a loan tomorrow, so if we file it, if we sign it, if we sign it, it'll take three or four hours.

Yeah.

So three hours later, we're going to have a loan that's going to be transferred from our original position to our own, and then we're going to have to pay for it.

Yeah.

Before I give you the customer loan, the chief of charge will be talking to you about making a phone call and paying you back, and then he'll pay you 35 million dollars in loans.

Yeah.

And then the next day, we're going to talk about re-reportment for this amount.

I mean, there's something I did wrong with, but I don't know if you're the substitute.

Yes, sir. He's a substitute.

It's not that I don't believe you, it's that I have to keep paying, so I'm taking a little risk, and I'm feeling a little nervous right now.

Yes, sir. I know that, sir.

I mean, I've been feeling a little nervous, and I've been looking at things like this, but I don't think I'm doing the wrong thing, not the wrong thing, because I've been doing it all the time.

So, sir, I can send you my ID to show your faith and send you my cell phone number. And you can trust me.

Yeah.

You're right, sir.

Yeah.

If you don't get your loan, you can call me, and I have a kid, and I have a wife, and I'm gonna show you the loan to tell you to report it, and that's not true.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Yeah.

Well... What do we do, and I'll just add a million and a half won tomorrow?

Now, if you can do that, then I'm going to sleep with my aunt and I'm going to check on her, and I'm going to get a hundred and fifty, and I can help you, but I'm just gonna ask you one favor, and you can't talk to my bank.

Yeah, she says she won't talk to you. She says she's helping you.

If you talk to my bank, I'm gonna get fired.

She knows that. She's too nervous right now.

That's why I told you, right? What kind of therapist wouldn't do this if he wasn't crazy? You're right.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Now, as I told you, I'm trying to help because I think of my wife and her as a kid.

I'm so glad you said that.

Yeah.

I'm so nervous right now that I don't have a million and a half dollars.

I know, sir.

And I'll see you, and I'll give you a million today, and I'll tell you what.

What we want for a million is if we buy the bonds tomorrow, we'll get the loan tomorrow, and in an hour, we'll be out of a million dollars' worth of cash in our support department.

Yeah.

And the cost of buying bonds on the day of tomorrow's day is re-payment.

Yeah.

Oh, you're so good. I'm in trouble. I can do it for $1.00.

Yeah.

You know what it's like, don't you?

Yeah, I know what it's like, I'm doing this kind of loan counseling on a loan phone, and I get a lot of crap, to be honest.

Yeah.

Do you understand that part, sir, because I'm only on the phone, so I don't think you're going to get too much credit for banks these days, and that's why we're having a lot of abuses, and frankly, we're having a lot of stress.

If the money's all gone now, if you don't talk to the substitute, then I'm too nervous to think about it.

That's why I'm sending you an ID.

Well...

Then if you don't call me, what's wrong with you? That doesn't mean I'm running away.

So tomorrow, you're gonna do the same thing as today?

Now we have to ask the recipient to do the same thing.

Yeah.

Yes, we're asking you to go to the bank and take care of it, sir.

Well, one thing I do today is I take it out of the bank and I take it out of the new village vault because I'm working.

Yeah.

I'm out of work right now.

Yeah.

I was working, and I couldn't get out, so today I took 15 to 20 minutes.

Yeah.

Well, you said your mother's post office was close.

Yeah, the post office is close. The post office is closest.

Well, then I'm going to ask you to let me get as close to you as possible, and if you tell me you have a doctor to run,

Well, since you say that, I need it anyway.

Yeah.

So, tomorrow, we'll be able to get the loan right away, right?

Right, so if you buy a bond, and you pay the gold depositor, and you tell the customer that you didn't maliciously do that, and you put it to our source, we'll check it at our place, and we'll pay you 40 million.

Yeah.

So before we give the 40 million dollar loan to the client at our pay, we'll call the client first, and we'll tell him how much we owe him, and then we'll give him the money.

Okay, then I'll do it.

Would you like to proceed?

Yeah, I'll do that. That's what my mother's saying.

Yeah, I'll send you an ID, then.

Yes, sir.

Okay, well, have a nice day, and I'll be back at work in the morning, sir.

It's nine o'clock.

9 o'clock? Can I call you at 8:50?

When?

8:50.

Yes, you can.

I'll call you at 8:50, since I'm going to work at 8:30 at 8:30, and I'll call you at 8:50 when I see you cleaning up your papers, not yours.

Yes, sir.

I'll send you an ID right now.

Yes, sir.

Yeah. Have a nice day.

"I'm sending you the paperwork.

Yeah.

So, if you sign up for your loan today, we're gonna have to send money to the main store, so... You told me that I was calling the chief of our settlement before I got out of the loan?

Yeah.

Yeah, and then you'll have to pay the customer directly for the loan.

Yeah.

I'll check my loan account again. One bank.

Yeah, that's right.

Yeah, right?

Yeah.

Sir, I'm telling you that I'm going to take care of you at our place for the first three months, and then three months later, I'm going to go to the main store.

Yes, sir.

He's my client, but he's got focused management at this point.

Yeah.

Because you've been sleeping for us, and you've been doing it for three months, you're gonna have to pay well, okay?

Oh, yeah.

I'm the one with the face again.

Oh, yeah.

I'm gonna be honest with you, but you're gonna have to keep an eye on that part because it's real.

And then you, sir.

It's going to be about 4:00 today, so, four or five.

This is what we do the first time, and if we get it done in the main store, it'll be five and a half o'clock at five and a half, and it'll be six o'clock.

Oh, he said he has to be a towel today.

I mean, five and a half and six, and what your client did last night, they're going to pay you back for an hour after the loan.

So it's gonna be seven o'clock. That's gonna be seven o'clock.

Yeah, that's right.

Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

And the cost of today's check is going to go out on Monday, so if you're out of $3 million, you're going to have to give me back the remaining $1.50.

Oh, yeah.

I'm gonna give you a call.

Yes, sir.

And one thing I'm going to tell you, sir, is that I lent it to you, so it's never a secret to my bank.

Oh, yeah. Okay.

Let me do this for you.

I'll see what I can do.

And if you call your client from the post office or the private bank, I told you a little bit yesterday, because there's some part of our bank support resources, and there's some part of the money that I put in.

Yeah.

That's why our supplier is now... Your recipient is a woman, and she lives in Seoul in '69.

Yes, sir.

That's why you're older than your aunt, and that's why you borrowed it from your aunt in Seoul.

Yeah.

I think if you tell me you're going to take care of it, I think you're going to take care of it.

Yes, sir.

Yeah, and I'm telling you this part, why do you know what I'm talking about?

Yeah.

Yeah, well, now that this part of the crew's gonna be late, there's a lot of phone calls in the dog because it's a real problem.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, that's why you can call your client, but you can't, but you can't afford to go because it's the end of the year.

Yeah, I get it.

Yeah, well, if you could tell me that part, it's gonna be normal for you to be in Seoul in '69.

Yeah.

I'll send it to your aunt, and then I'll make it quick for you to get your loan.

About four weeks.

I didn't hear you say that at first.

That's what happens now when we're dealing with issues that we don't have to deal with.

It's not an indiscretion, it's all our approval.

Oh, but I've been approved, and if it's part of the deal, it's just...

Yeah, well, if it's inaugural, then it's in return, not because it's been approved, but because the client has come out of his office.

I told the police that I had been lied to for a while.

You called the police? What have you been cheated on?

They said it was used as a cannon.

Yours? What happened to you?

Yeah, well, the agent knows that.

You don't have an agent, but you're here today.

You've been dismissed today?

Yeah, he quit today. What's the matter with you?

He offered me a loan yesterday and led me into a bank account deal.

The bank account? Did you give him the badge?

No, I didn't give you that badge, but it didn't work out, so you had to get a deal if you wanted to.

So if he gets a deposit to get that deal, he'll pay for it...

Did your client send you a deposit?

Yeah.

He told you to give it to the extraction team?

That's why you gave me the money? How much?

You said you were out of work.

When I thought I was right to tell you that I was out of work, what did you say at the police station?

I've called it off, sir.

You're being punished, aren't you?

I haven't done that yet, so let's just wait. I'm a victim in a way.

But even if he was a victim, you gave him the money, didn't you?

I did? I talked to the police there, and they asked me to wait.

I don't know if you're going to the police station and you're gonna pay for this, but you're going to jail.

So he asked me to wait first.

There's been a report. What about it?

Yeah, that's why I went to work with the police.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you? Oh, my God, sir.

So why didn't you answer the phone? You've been breaking up.

We are? I didn't quit.

You said you'd keep connecting me in the morning, but you couldn't keep connecting me.

Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, the agent couldn't even call me, and now he's gone.

You can't get in touch?

"But you're doing what you said. Now, we can go a little bit easier, and if you're a good customer, you know, you know, if you don't know, those of you who don't have a lot of recent deals, you know, you're using long-term markets for a while. Now, you know, you know, for five years and ten years, you've got people who keep eating the right gold. Some of you, or some of you, are now doing a little bit of presbytery processing on your side. They're the ones who get us out of the field, and they haven't given us any formalities or pensions.

Uh, I don't think so.

Well, then, yes, please.

No, no, no. I don't think so.

Oh, yeah. So we're going to take that into account and we're going to do a little bit of savings, and you're having a hard time getting a 30 million dollar deposit right now.

Two or three thousand.

Yes if you can. Yes.

So you want me to put two or three grand in there?

So it's kind of hard for you to take care of your savings to my people's banks, yeah, it's a bit of a challenge for you to have a part of it or something like that.

If you do that, you're going to have to pay for it, and you're going to put two or three dollars in it, and then you're going to have to pay for it.

Yes, sir.

I mean, that's what you're talking about, you know, for years.

I can't hear you.

So let's put these three thousand over there.

Yes, sir.

You can find those two or three thousand right away, or you can tie them up for more than a few years.

No, it's not. I mean, if you're a long-term president and you're a long-term president and you're gonna have to pay for it for more than three months, would you mind if you paid for that?

Two or three thousand if I could take it for two or three months and then I could take it out?

Of course, sir. You can do that.

So, is there any kind of place where this is a placebo fee or something like this? Cancelment fee? Payment fee?

There's no such thing. Three months later, there's no such thing as that, but yes, there's no such thing.

So how much do we have?

I think that's exactly what you're going to have to do, but it's not expensive.

Well, first of all, I'm going to take this and I'm going to take this and I'm going to take the negative of it, and then I'm going to borrow it again.

Yeah.

If I get here, I don't have to pay for the negatives, right?

That's right.

I think that's all right.

Well, then you're using a minus sign.

Yes, sir.

If that's the case, I think you should do it now, because it takes a while. Even if this is a baby right now, at least for a month, we'll be watching and we'll have to make sure the point goes up, sir. It's gonna take you a while to get this done, but is it okay for you to do that?

So you can get it in a month. You can get it in three months?

A month later, if we're able to get a point on our side, we can get an approval, and now the customer can get that deposit back in three months.

And in a month, it's going to be there and it's going to be a loan.

Yeah.

What I can do is I can't do it in three months.

Okay, well, how do you think you're gonna be okay with that time?

But if I can make sure that I get five thousand, then that's possible, because it's not efficient to get these three thousand dollars for the minus.

That's right. So that time, whatever it might be, it's a little bit of a challenge, and it's a little bit of a waste of money, if it's a little bit of a disproportionate, if it's a little bit of a challenge, if it's a little bit of a challenge, if it's a little bit of a challenge, if it's a little bit of a challenge, if it's a little bit of a challenge, if it's a little bit of a challenge, if it's a little bit of a challenge, if it's a little bit of a challenge, if it's a little bit of a deal, if it's a little bit of a bit of a cost. You can't see two hundred. So with that in mind, we're going to build some of those people into self-help funding, and then we're going to take care of them a little bit more quickly, just as you did with the deal, and then we're going to take care of them a little bit more quickly.

Can you tell me that again? I'm...

I mean, it's all about the fact that if you do it yourself, it's going to cost you money, and it's going to cost you a lot of time. Yeah, so, since we're at the sales department anyway, we need to get approved quickly, because we're running up the track, too, sir. So we can use our self-saving funds to make sure that our recipients have the same account as the one who set up the passport, and then we can use your client's support to make that work, and now we can take it back to the customer and make it approved.

So what happens when they make it into a joint account?

It's not a joint account. It's not a joint account. We're going to make that in terms of the customer's two suits, and then we're going to put them on the bank account. The record itself.

The record itself.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

So that's where I'm going to go from there to there.

The pressure client has to pay for it, and there's no such thing.

Really?

Yes, sir.

Oh, I don't think I understand 100% right now. What do they do now, what do they do to my bank account?

I'm going to send you the money first.

I'm going to give you the negative amount of money that I want to borrow.

No, no, no.

And what about it?

I'm going to send you the money first by the name of one of our bank employees. Now, please send me that bond first, sir. You send the amount of the bond first, and now you put it in your bond, and now you put it on paper as your bond, and then you take care of it, and you put it in your bank account. Now in your bank account, we're going to do the last thing we can do, and we're going to make a deposit on your name, and you're going to be a client, but if you're going this fast through our bank staff, you don't have to wait for that period.

And that means that the money from that employee's money is coming in this way.

Yeah.

You're saying you're going through my account.

That's right.

So you're saying money's coming in?

Yes, sir.

How much is it?

Uh, I think it's between two and 30 million dollars, sir.

When three thousand dollars come in from two thousand,

Yeah.

So what happens when you come in?

So now we're going to transfer the bonds to your client's name, and we're going to do it before, and then we're going to change it to your name, and then we're going to do it, and we're going to take it back.

And then what happens when you get approved? I'm going to return two or three thousand on my way in.

No, sir. That's money to get out, sir. You know, it's your money to get out, and if you get that approval now, we're gonna have to send you a call order, and you're gonna have to get a new one, sir. If it's about a long time, it's going to take about four days, or two days.

Oh, now that I understand, can you tell me if that's right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's not money coming in, it's something else coming in, right? So this is going to be equal to 3000.

Yeah.

The record of coming in and leaving, the name of the bond or whatever.

That's right.

They're leaving two or three thousand records.

Yes, that's right.

So money doesn't actually come in.

It's actually money.

You think money's coming and they're taking it away?

That's right.

I mean, money comes in and leaves a record of it being taken away, so that's where they put the money, and then they take it off. I'm going to subtract. That's what I do, that's what I do.

Yes, sir.

Oh, it doesn't matter if it's yours.

If you do it yourself, it's expensive, it's time-consuming, but it doesn't have to be hard for you to do it on the name of my bank employee.

Oh, my God.

So let's say...

Yes, sir. Now I understand.

Yeah, and the reason why this is happening is to be honest, we're selling, sir. You know the same side of the election. We need to get approved quickly. Uh, if I'm working like in the window, I can handle it easy, but it's not what we're mostly dealing with, sir. I'm doing this because it's a department that's in order to get out, and to be honest with you, you understand that I'm stacking up real estate through a bank employee, and that's a hundred percent personal credit.

Yes.

If you think about sending that money first, then I'm just gonna trust you to do it.

Yeah.

I have to take responsibility for sending that bond myself if you're going to use it, if you're going to lose it, if you're going to leave it on your own, if you're going to leave it on your own. So I believe you, and I'm going to have to do it, and I'm going to do it, so if you understand that, I'll do it for you.

Yes, sir.

Oh, yeah. So do state banks only use private banks?

Uh, uh... No, with the Agronoms.

Oh, yeah.

Aggregation and the People

You're only using two.

There's a new guy who manages other things and leaves with other money.

Yeah.

I've got a company, but it's different money, different uses.

Oh, the dragon.

Yeah.

He's new and he's an entrepreneur, and he doesn't use it much.

Yeah.

Because you're all your own account anyway.

Yeah.

Why do you even have that check card if it's going to work?

There's a check card company checking the bank.

You do, don't you?

What?

You have a check card for all four of your brand-new National Agronoms.

The company certainly has a check card.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

The people seem to have a check card, but they don't use it, and they have an agricultural settlement.

Yeah.

There's no God.

There's no God.

Yeah.

And that made sense to me. I need to explain something more.

No, no, no, no. I get it.

Yes, and you have a choice, and if I'm a good customer like this, and I'm going to stack it up, and then I'm going to do it, you're going to be good, but you're not willing to increase it, are you?

Oh, I want $50.

Oh, you want to?

I want to pay back the minus, but three thousand.

Uh-huh.

I want some extra.

Oh, well, that's better.

So let's say that this right over here is going to be equal to-- let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is a negative, let's say this is equal to negative, let's say that this is equal to negative, let's say that this is equal to negative, let's say this is equal to negative, let's say that this is equal to negative, let's say that this is equal to negative, let's say that this is equal to negative, let's say this is equal to negative, let's say, let's say that this is equal to be equal to negative, let's say, let's take negative, let's take negative, let's take negative, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say that this, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say that this is, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's, let's say, let's

I'll tell you, if you want an extra dose, it's permanent. I barely got it.

I'm the best in the world.

He didn't say that to me. He asked for it.

Yes.

And you're going to have an extra solution. So let's say you're doing something, but honestly, I have to trust you to do it.

Yes, sir.

If you're going to have to add up, it's going to be about 40 million dollars in advance, and that's a lot of money, to be honest, it's a lot of money.

Yes.

Yeah, but honestly, I'm doing this on my own. You can't do this to anyone, sir. Yeah, that's why I'm doing this. I believe you're working on it, so if you do that, you'll have to be ready to go ahead, and you'll have to make sure you don't lose all the money. Yes, sir, and I'd like to give you a deposit on some of those accounts right now. When I think about it, it's going to take more than one or three of them to get faster.

Then let's do it with the people.

Yeah.

It's an out-of-the-box.

Yeah.

Shall we do it as a company?

Is that so? You don't have any credit cards? You don't use it well?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Oh, yeah? Then don't let it go, sir.

Yes, sir.

If that's the case, if you'd like to know something about the other side right now, I'm going to text you the company bank's headquarters, the customer support center number, and I'm going to send you a message, and I'm going to call you, and I'm going to check that card for a day, and I'm going to ask you to call me back, and I'm going to ask you to check out the transfers, and I'm going to ask you to do that.

Yeah, that's what I found out.

So if we look at your interest rate and how much money you're going to pay, we can do things like this. We're going to figure out how much time we're going to take.

Oh, that's the kind of money that goes in there?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I, uh, hold on. I understand, but there's another question.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

The bond money says I'm coming in and I'm getting out, and I have to give you some card code or something for that, and they're gonna have to free me up?

No, sir. And in order to do that, sometimes what I'm saying is that you're not going to be able to do that.

Yes.

You know you need to meet with us. You have to come to our office, or you have to do this. He's a visitor.

Oh, so I found the money, I put it, I put it, and this is what I'm supposed to do?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Uh-huh.

Because that's where you're moving the money, and you're doing it in our chat room. We don't usually ask for your secret number or anything like that, sir.

Yes, sir.

You know what I mean.

Yes.

But if you have a hard time telling me the story, or if you have a hard time telling me the story, or if you're going to tell me the number of secrets and the number of important information I'm giving you, I'm not going to ask you the number and I'm not going to ask you the number, but if I'm going to get that check, and I'm going to do it for three days, and I'm going to do it on a schedule, and I'm going to do it for three days, and I'm going to do it three hours, and I'm going to do it for three hours, and I'm going to do it for three hours, and I'm going to do it three hours, and I'm going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to tell you's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours and three hours, and three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I'm going to do it for three hours, and three hours, and three hours, and three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it three hours, and I's going to tell you's going to do it three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it three hours, and I's going to do it three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours, and I's going to do it for three hours

That's how I met you, and all I could do was...

Uh, I'm sure you'll have time for it sometime, sir.

In the morning...

In the morning?

Yeah.

Is it possible to visit her in her intended office?

Yeah, well, what time am I gonna go over there?

Okay, so when you're a kid, first of all, I'm looking at your schedule right now. I'll check my schedule again and call you back, sir.

Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

Yeah.

"This is how the local testing process is supposed to work.

Yeah.

If you're going to take it today, we're going to have tomorrow, uh, test results are usually going to be three to four o'clock, based on the watershed.

Yes, and we'll finish the deal before seven o'clock at night. I'm going to go straight into the parlance. Can you check your bank account right now?

Yeah.

Yeah. Would you please call me your account number?

It's an OOO. Yes, sir, please check your name.

Uh, now I'm sending you the article.

Yeah.

I'm gonna ask you to check your address for me.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

You don't have any lakes, do you?

If you'll call me when you're here, I'll...

I'll handle it that well in the middle. Yes, and, uh, as you know, sir. These financial items, such as the card or the cash notice, are now banned, so we're going to give them this kind of security as if they're not a card, and we're going to send them to our driver through our driver right now.

Yeah.

Uh, you're gonna have to make sure it's not in there, just like it's not in there with a card or a badge or something like that.

Yeah.

If I could show you how to pack a box. Uh, it's great if you have that sneakers box.

Yes.

Oh, yeah. There you go. Yeah, it doesn't matter if it's smaller or bigger than that, but it's a size interview.

Yeah.

If you have an athletic box, please put it in a box so that the checkcard doesn't damage the magnetic part or the IC chip, so that you don't have anything to throw away, or the magazine, or the newspaper, or whatever, and put it into the box.

Yeah.

So that your weight doesn't get too light, so that you don't suspect it, you can put something in an empty room, or a newspaper, or something else you can throw away, or something you can hang around, or something you can wear. If you fill it up with that, you're not in doubt anymore.

Oh, yeah.

So we're going to show you things, so we're going to fill in the material a little bit, and then we're going to need to use a box tape to sort out the box.

Yeah.

How much time do you expect to have if someone in the middle doesn't really open it so you can just get our guy to open it right away?

It's possible right away.

If that's the case, I'll wrap it up, and then I'll just ask you to call me back.

Yeah.

Oh, I've got to rent an office right now. Yeah.

I'll pack it for you if you get it right away.

Oh, I'm just saying. I'm going to grab that box in appearance, or the weight of the material right now, because I'm going to take that item and I'm going to take it as an item, and I'm going to put it in. I just don't want you to accept it if you just take it without an item.

Yeah.

Oh, on the office side, so I'll just wrap it up, and then I'll call you back.

Yes, sir.

Yes, thank you. Yeah.

"I'm so frustrated. Right now? Sir, it's you, is it you?

Yeah.

It's not his name, it's him.

No, sir. I spoke through the bank.

You're so frustrated, man.

I'm the bank...

No, you can see the results. It's complicated what's going on right now. It's very, very complicated.

I'll call the police and I'll be punished if I take sides, and if I do wrong, I'll be punished. But I'm not going to do this.

Well, that's true.

I don't really know how to get people out of this shit.

No, I'm not convinced right now. I don't know what's going on with us. Everything you're talking about is a lie. Now.

What do you mean, I'm a liar?

We're not in that situation. What are you...

I want you to repeat the situation.

He hasn't spoken to you before.

Did he call you?

Yeah.

Oh, because I've been doing silver and making phone calls and making direct contact with the bank customer center, the bank will do it.

Where'd you call the bank bank right now? Banks?

It's an anastomosis.

You're the bank. Or the other bank over there?

The other bank.

Your bank? Did you call the headquarters call?

Oh, yeah, that's right.

Oh, my God. I don't know. Now.

I can’t help it if I don’t know. Anyway, I'm being called to the police in a situation that's so embarrassing, so I'm on the phone, and I can't return the money, and I'm going to return it through the police station, and you know that. And so far, all the calls have been lost, so if they report me, I will report. You know that. Even if you treat people like idiots, they don't.

Sir, I'm recording all your insults.

Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

Yeah.

Do you have anything else to say? And I...

I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm making sure that I'm doing it through the bank, so if I'm not doing it through the bank anymore, I'm going to do it through the police. They called me in.

We called the police.

Yes, please report. It's called in.

Oh, it's being reported. We called him.

There's been a call at the police station.

We've been picked up by the Boys. We are.

Are you kidding me?

Why would I do this now? Why would I do this now?

Yeah, well, I've made the right call, but if I do that, I'm going to report it as innocent. You know that, and I'll talk to you later.

"My name is Kim Ho-cheol, and I was born in Guangju, and I was a 40-year-old man, and I worked for 10 years at a farm bank.

Yeah.

Uh, who doesn't know?

Yeah.

Uh, because our prosecutors just arrested seven financial criminal frauds who were responsible for Kim Ho-cheol. They're doing some arrests, they're doing some confiscation in the office, and they've got a bunch of stolen items in the office, and they've got copies of their credit cards, security cards, faked IDs, and so on, and we've confiscated the ceilings. In the process of sorting out the confiscated goods, I've been calling you to make sure that I've found two bank accounts in the name of Mr. OO. Uh, we checked into the financial institutions, and the accounts are right, and we're looking at, so the starting point is May 17, 2016, and it's Tuesday, and it's Tuesday. It was about five months ago, and it was confirmed that each of the new accounts had been opened in a game called the Gyponics. Isn't that Mr. O'O's head of staff?

I'm not.

It's been used in crime, so we can't use it anymore.

Yeah, yeah.

Take care of it when it's done.

Yeah.

All the money in it has now been taken over.

Yeah.

But what's important now is that, before we did that, we had three and eight million dollars in the OO's farm account, and one bank account had seven and a half million dollars in illegal funds.

Yeah.

This money, this money, created a lot of victims. This was an incident where the Kim Ho-ho workers registered OO as a seller online, and they said,

Yeah.

Yeah, well, I'd like to fly at high prices, and I'd like to post some of these tickets and sell them at low prices.

Yes.

I'll give everyone who calls on it now an OO account, a list of names.

Yeah.

If you send me your money, I'll send you your money, and I'll take your money, and I'll take it, and I'll tell you, it's a fraud that didn't send you anything.

Yeah.

The fraud was used by OO's name and the head of the OO's artillery, and then there's the property victims who gave the money to Mr. OO's artillery.

Yeah.

I've been sending money to buy things, but I don't have to call them in the future without getting there, so I've just been charging them for fraud.

Yeah.

Now that OO is still registered as a seller, OO has a complaint in front of you.

Yeah.

You know, I'm not involved in any of these investigations, so if you're on this case, and you're on this kind of theft, then the victim is right, and if you're on the evidence of the victim, then I'm going to help you get your innocence. I'm not going to, uh, I'm not going to do the freezing on the account for OO's bank account by saying what I'm going to do now, OO. Where's OO's financial institution that he's using by opening his own account? Just give me the names of the financial institutions. So, you've got a new silver bank, a national bank, a post office savings bank, and you've never had a stock company, or a new village vault, or a Neong-hye? If you're in your own account, just tell me exactly, and we won't do the freezing. Yes, if each account fits your account, will you remember today's systematic balance? Yeah, if your account is correct, we don't have to do the freezing, so I'm going to make a comparison, and I don't need the exact amount. You're going to make a brief statement about less than $10,000, less than half a million, less than a million, and then you're going to decide that if you're less than half a dollar, you're going to be in your account.

Yeah.

I'm going to start with a new bank, and I'm going to start with a new bank. How much balance does a new bank deposit account make for your own account?

You're familiar with the man you're named Jeong-joon, aren't you? Yes, I'm Jung-joon. Oh, I'll once again give you an accurate description of this guy. Uh, a guy named Jeong-joon was born in Guangju before that. I'm from Guangju. From high school to social life, he's been active in Seoul, and he's been a 40-year-old male for about 10 years. It's Jung-joon. Who doesn't know you at all? Because recently, the prosecutors arrested seven people in all of the financial criminal frauds who were responsible for this politics. But in the process, a friend of ours, Jing Jing Jing, was arrested because he had two bank accounts, one of the OO's farm contracts, and he had two. Uh, you know Mr. O'O in a regular statement. Is that true? I can't tell you my account number because it's a prize, but I'll tell you where I'm made of this. We're looking at a financial institution, and on May 17, 2016, we're seven o'clock in the game, so we're each in the new accounts, and we're the president of a bank. Are you sure this is yours?

",,1
"Thank you. This is the central branch of Seoul.

Yeah.

I'm a task force of 10 million criminal investigations.

Yeah.

I've contacted you on some of your own personal information leaks. Are you all right on the phone?

Yeah.

Yeah, let me ask you a few questions. Do you know of a man named OO, Mr. moonhee?

No, I don't know who he is.

Have you ever heard of him?

Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

You have no idea.

Yeah.

Let me start with a little bit of an incident.

Yeah.

We just arrested a financial criminal fraud centering around the moonshee.

Yeah.

We found lots of check cards and cannons in the field at the time of the hunt.

Yeah.

We also confiscated two accounts under the control of Kim Eun-sun's name.

Yeah.

When we checked, the game went from light time to hour apart. Do you know anything about these two accounts?

No, sir.

Don't you think you've opened it yourself?

Yeah.

One of our banks is the president of the bank.

A team of investigations arrested a financial rights fraud centering around the moonshee.

Yeah.

At the time of the arrest, we confiscated a large quantity of check cards, cannons, and copied IDs, and one of the things that's in front of us is that we're now confiscating two copies of OO's name.

Yeah.

When we checked, the game came to light, and it opened on the fourteenth day of August of '15. One of our banks is the president of the bank. Are these two presidents personally opening up?

I don't know.

You opened it last year?

No, I'll call the police and check it out.

I'm not a cop. Call the prosecutor.

Yeah.

Uh, we've looked at the whole story on our side, and the result is that in the case of OO, there's no previous record, and the debt is clear, and there's not much evidence of the primary agreement.

Yeah.

But our D.A. investigation says we're a fraud with only a heart attack, and we can't classify it like this.

Yeah.

Yes, and that's why the investigation into the victim's position is going to go a little bit further.

Yeah.

The investigation of the victim's position is because he has no primary point of consultation, and later, if he finds a point of agreement, he will be present and present for our decision, and then he will have to be investigated.

Yes, sir.

Do you understand? And yes, and the whole process of surveying the victim's position is done with rust. Because this is evidence that will be submitted to the court on your behalf, if you mix the noise around you or the voice of someone else, there's some evidence that's more effective, less effective. And just because you're green, there's nothing really special about it, and I'm going to put that question right there.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's what the investigation is all about. You've got to keep doing great.

There's nothing else that I've asked you about, and I'm going to put the questions that I've been asking you about before. I'll put it in a rust, and once the phone's over, I'll give you a little connection on the inside. You're going to have to check the public statement in front of you, and you're going to be able to explain the case in more detail. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? Do you understand anything?

Yeah, I can talk right now.

Yeah, yeah, I think you've been working for a while. Please answer the phone. So I'm going to start quickly with rusting first.

Yeah, can I do that?

No, sir. It's a melting phone together, and it could cause some problems with the receiver.

Oh, yeah? But...

Yeah, well, I'm not asking you any big questions. I'm going to rust.

.

",,1
"Hello?

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, it's not the other thing, it's the fact that the OO's got the name of the person involved that we're working on, and it's going to be on our side.

Oh, yeah.

I called to make sure.

Yeah.

Uh, you're OO yourself, right?

Yeah.

Now, with this used country website, we're going to register a very expensive product, and now we're going to be inducted into it, and we're not going to charge it, so we're going to have money in the middle.

Yeah.

So it's now classified as a financial crime fraud, so our high-tech crime investigation is now in progress. Now, the part of the problem is the bank account that led to the deposit, right?

Yeah.

The president himself is now in use, including OO's, the victims of a lot of thefts. Now that there's been a withdrawal accident, there's a lot of victims who don't have enough of their goods and now have all the financial damage that they're paying for.

Yes.

Now that you're in charge now, how do you get this complaint, and they usually have their own bank account?

Yeah.

The president's name now decides that the crime is involved. Victims.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, so they're suing the bank account's depositor right now. So that's what we're about to do now with charges against the victims of the theft of their names. In the case of OO's, there's now two banks of the Agricultural Association, and now there's a complaint against them at 18 times.

Yeah.

That's why we called this complaint so that we could take some action.

Yeah.

He's classified as a non-invasive victim, and now he's in charge, and we've got no evidence to prove it, so we've contacted him because we don't have any evidence on our side. So what we've been talking about is, you know, the whole statement.

Yeah.

And I'm going to ask you again with a vaginal response, which is what OO knows, what you don't know, and you can tell me your no. I'm going to leave this as a green tape, and we're going to submit this green tape to your evidence, so if you submit the evidence, it's obvious that you're going to use it when it's adopted, by the judge. I'm his investigator now, and I'm going to write you some green tape, and you're going to be the head of staff for the OO case. Well, why don't you go ahead and get a look at the case that you've been given to OO yourself?

Yeah.

I'd like to ask you a few questions before we proceed to rust.

Oh, I'd rather not do this right now, and I'd check it out, and I'd like to talk to you through a lawyer.

Is that why you're refusing to avoid it?

The victims are inoculated. For many of the victims who have been robbed, it's now possible to open the front page with fake IDs. It's no longer a regular OO account, it's now a legal one. Same as every single thief and victim. Have you ever used an OO-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N? The president of the corporation?

I'll call you back on the central finger.

Don't say that. Then call with a representative number and call with a statement.

Yeah, I will.

Do you need to say something so offensive?

The one who called right now said he's weird. I'll call you back. Or you can take it.

Yeah, you can do that. XXX.

And the reason why I'm going to ask you about jobs is because in the course of research, people who are probably uncertain about their jobs, or who are uncertain about their pensions, ask the Kim Young-seok community this professional question, because they now have a financial reward and there's both the sales and the selling of bank notes. And because we did this part of the research and we did it separately, and it was illegal to use the Bank of the Agrocs, one bank, for two bank presidents, we found that immediately I found out that the freeze treatment went into effect. Do you know what freezing means?

Yeah.

About the damage money that was in it... We're taking action, and you're against this, Mr. O'Malley?

No, sir.

You're right about the situation where you're saying you don't object to the fact that you're not the president and you're not the president.

Yeah, yeah.

You're in trouble right now. As I mentioned in the dictionary, we still haven't been able to hunt all the Kim Young-suk's parties. There's another set of accounts in OO's name that will be found if you've caught these people. Since this case is a financial crime fraud case, our prosecutors are in the middle of a joint investigation with the financial director. If you find an account that you don't know after tracking your account, we're going to have to take you to an illegal account, and we're going to need you to give you a simple answer to OO's mutual financial issues in order to get the first freeze treatment. Now, the investigation agency itself has the authority to investigate, and even under the circumstances of execution, it's not possible to ask about personal credit information.

Yeah, yeah.

For example, you can never get your account number or account password or anything like that, and you're now going to do a contrasting job with the number of accounts or the number of accounts you have. I don't know if it's illegal funds, but it's a mix of illegal accounts. It's like... I'm going to ask you now to find out if you're serious, and so we've got a lot of other people who've been investigated in some part of the money. In this part of the world, we don't even ask for detailed funding, we just do it in the other direction. If you're in charge of setting up your assets to prove that you're a normal fund, you're usually going to check everything out, so you don't have to worry too much.

"Hello?

Yeah.

Good morning. Do you have a cell phone?

Where are you?

Good evening. This is the Seoul Central Attorney General's Office.

Yeah.

Yes, I've been calling you for some confirmation.

Yeah.

Do you know Kim Insoo?

I don't know.

Because last week, I arrested Kim Insu.

Yeah.

He confiscated a large amount of credit cards and cannons at the scene of your arrest, and among them, he found a good bank account for his own farm.

Yeah.

I called to see if you knew about those two accounts.

I don't know.

I'm not asking about your bank account. He called me because he was the president of illegal law in his name.

So what?

Can you take a note? I'll give you my case number and my name.

Yes.

The case number is 2016 Hankul. It's a 4318 Induk financial fraud.

Yeah.

He's been arrested last week, he's been on the scene, he's been on the scene, he's been on the scene, he's been on the scene, he's been on the scene, he's got personal information, he's been on the scene, he's been arrested, he's been on the scene, he's been on the scene, he's been on the scene, he's been arrested last week, he's been on the scene, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets, he's been on the streets,

Yes.

I'm a public investigator for the Central GEI team in Seoul.

Yeah.

He's the C.O.O. at the center of Seoul. What kind of silver did you usually do and deal with?

It's KB.

Only two banks had a deal, right?

Yeah.

I'll freeze you right away if you have any other bank assistants out there.

Yeah.

Yes, sir. We're going to send you a warrant for the victim in front of you. If you take it to the first floor of the hearing, it's a public reward.

Yes.

It's $60,000 per dollar, so you've got two right now, haven't you? You've got two new farmers, haven't you?

Yes.

You can get damage compensation from a million dollars and a half out of personal information spills.

Yes.

You haven't opened your own account.

Yes.

His name has been stolen, so he can be compensated for his damage due to a leak in personal information.

Yes.

Have you ever opened a badge for anyone?

No, I didn't.

Yes, sir. You said you're dealing with an agricultural bank, so you've made the last deal, so how much of your account should you have left?

The last deal on the farm?

That's right. You have your last deal, roughly.

That was about three or four months ago.

It's a regular deposit.

Yes.

Totalo. You said you'd use three of them. Totalo...

Thank you, sir. This is the Seoul Central Attorney General's Office.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

I've been calling you for some confirmation from now on.

Yes, sir.

Do you know Kim Insoo?

Who is it?

I'm Kim Insoo, 30-eight-year-old male.

I don't know.

Yeah, 'cause last week, I arrested Kim Insu.

Yeah.

He confiscated a large amount of credit cards and artillery in the scene of the hunt, and among them, he found a very good bank manager who was doing his own agricultural work.

Yeah.

I'm just trying to make sure you know something about the account.

My name is... That's my name?

In his own name, our farming company is doing good, and our new bank is doing good.

Wait a minute. Hello?

Yes, sir.

No, there's no such thing.

I'm not asking you about your bank account.

Yes.

He's doing his own trade-offs, and he's finding a new law enforcement officer, so I'm calling him.

Yeah.

You know, Kim Insoo, right?

I don't know. Yeah.

If you're leaking information, do you have any idea which way it came from?

Where'd you call me?

I'm with the Central GEI in Seoul.

Why do you say that?

Oh, yeah. Check it for yourself. If that's the case, it's the right thing to do.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

I've been calling you for some confirmation. Do you know Kim Insoo?

No, I don't know him.

But because last week, I arrested Kim Insu.

Yeah.

He confiscated a large amount of credit cards and artillery in the scene of the hunt, and among them, he found a very good bank manager who was doing his own agricultural work.

Oh, yeah.

I was just trying to make sure you knew about the account.

No, sir. I don't know him.

I'm not asking you about your bank account. I've called you because we've been working on our farm in our own name, and we've found a new president of a bank that's illegal.

Oh, yeah.

I've called you to make sure you know it's Kim Insoo.

"But...

What do you want me to do?

Yes, there should be about two million won in the name of your client.

Oh, I don't have any money right now.

Oh, that's something you need to get through with your clients.

No, no, no. I'm not gonna do that. Oh, yeah. You never said that before.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

Then, customers, if you want to stop this part, you're going to need a little bit of time.

Oh, three years. He said it would take more than three months.

Yeah, between six months and a year.

So, how do we do that?

As I said, this is the only solution.

Oh, I don't think so. I think.

Well, if you're going to solve this, you're going to have to wait and ignore the fine.

No, you didn't say that from the beginning.

Am I your client from the beginning?

Can I talk to that guy for the first time?

It's hard right now. Now, the papers are on our side, and now they're on our team, and they're right over to me.

Yeah.

I'm the new director, sir.

So, what are they doing? You said you called them first?

I'll be right back.

I think I've been hit. Right now?

What?

I think I got it.

What do you mean? Sir, do you know why this million won?

Why?

You're supposed to have about three and a half million dollars in your bank account right now, you know.

Oh, yeah, I do.

You have an example?

Yeah.

Sir, we need you to get it back to us.

Yeah.

Yeah, but you're shutting down your client's account right now.

Yes.

You're off the deal, aren't you?

Yes.

That's why I need you to pay me back my client's money.

Yes.

And then you're gonna have to stop this loan from our side, and now you're going to have three and a half million dollars to take, and you're going to have to give it to us first.

That's what I'm talking about.

No, you didn't say that.

That's what I'm talking about, sir.

Yes.

Now that we're on our side,

Yes.

I'm on the phone right now.

Yes.

How can I tell you?

Then if you release the report, I'll send you back.

I can't do that, sir.

Why not?

Why not? That's what we did on our side in the first place, and now that you're building a deal with our funds,

Yes.

I can't help it because I suspect your work loan. That can't be solved by our side. Either you're waiting and you're paying the fine, or you're either going to have to work this out or you're going to have to choose between you. There's only two solutions.

What happens if I cancel now?

I told you. As I said, you just have to wait and ignore the fine.

What kind of fine are you talking about?

It's a work loan fine. Now, since your loan is illegal,

You said it was legal and you called me.

It's legal. Our product itself. But in the meantime, you should have built up your client's deal, but you didn't.

Oh, I didn't say that, so I wouldn't do that.

Well, that's not what you're saying. We're on our way right now, sir.

Yeah.

I thought your client's deal was good, and I thought you had some.

Where is that?

I don't know where that is. We don't know anything about you.

Then you should've asked me in the first place.

I'll tell you one thing, sir. Do we have any information from your birth in the first place? Or not?

Oh, that's not true.

No, it's not. So we don't know what you're doing, we don't know what you're doing, we know what you're doing, we know what you're doing, we know what you've done before? That's not true.

No, when you said that this is how the process works, I would respond to it.

So you don't say that because, on average, there's an average number of people on the average who are making loans for our country. But for those of you who are too short-term like you, you should have built this up once. But you're not. Why don't all the clients check you out? You can't verify everything. Because he's not himself. You're right. Is there something wrong with me?

Uh-huh. Yes, sir. And then...

What would you do?

I'll take it as an unprecedented one.

And you'll get about five million won.

Yeah.

Yeah, well, you'll be free in about six months or a year, and that's how you know it.

Yes, sir. I've recorded all the calls here.

Yeah.

I'm going to throw it out and I'm going to try to figure it out.

Oh, so do it.

Yes, sir.

I'm just asking us to do something legal right now.

Oh, I'm not gonna do it legally, but I'm gonna have to report it.

So, as you say, it's legal, and we're ready. With our legal team.

Just send me that check card.

We're gonna take you out of the way, and you're gonna have to get yourself back.

Did you do that to me in the first place?

When did I start with you? When did I call you from the beginning?

No, let me talk to that employee.

It's just time to go home. Do you know?

So if you call me tomorrow, can you take it with him?

Yeah. What do you mean, he's your friend? We should call him Darryl. He says you're a client, doesn't he?

So can I talk to you tomorrow?

I can do it. Where do you want me to keep yelling? Why are you so angry?

No, you're not mad at me right now?

I'm not a general therapist.

Yes.

Think carefully and get angry with your client. I can get angry.

I'll call you back tomorrow.

Don't fight me out loud with your client.

I'll call you back tomorrow.

Yeah, I'll tell you what I'm saying. I'll call you tomorrow.

We're going to do it for them, but they don't tell us that they're lending us loans, they're doing some ratings, and now I'm running them.

Yeah. So maybe I won't do it for you. I've been doing a lot of bypass lately.

Yeah.

Because it's early, and it's an oral failure, and it's a lot of loans for people who know it.

Like this? Uh-huh.

Well, the first thing I'm going to tell you is that I have 27,743,377 dollars, sir.

Yeah.

We only have $2.7 million in lead, except for the back seat. Because that's how he's going to pay it to us.

Yeah, yeah.

And that's what makes you think positively.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's what they're gonna charge us for. If you return it to your client,

How much?

US$ 2.7 million.

Yeah.

Uh, I'll get it for you. I'll let you know. Sir.

Yeah. So let's say I checked it out.

Yes, sir.

Can I call you?

Yeah, I do. I think you can call me after you finish your lead.

Yes, sir.

We'll figure it out.

Yes, thank you.

Yes.

Yeah.

Yeah.

"I'm sorry. I need you to give me a little tour for someone else because of your loan right now.

Yeah.

Sir. I'll show you the weather change system right now.

Yeah.

You've got a $1007 million loan, so when you see it, all you're paying is interest.

Yeah.

But it doesn't mean that you're paying the loan. Now that we're out of control...

Yeah.

You've already got a loan, and you've completed it in less than six months.

Yeah.

That's why you're in the middle of it right now, if you're paying $27 million for the non-encascated Capital, you're paying $40 million in the Lydde Capitol right now.

Yeah.

You can't do this right now. I think we're going to have to complete one of these loans.

Really?

Yeah, but that's not what you're feeling right now.

Yeah.

And that's why it's so difficult, and I'm telling you that we're going to be on a climate change system today. There's no weather change system that day.

Yes.

It's just that, basically, you've been paid $27 million in loans at the Vimke Capital.

Yeah.

It's easy to say that today you're going to get this three million dollar loan, whether it's from a card to a card to a million dollars. It's the party.

Yes.

So you can call one of the customers on your card this evening or tomorrow morning and pay the loan directly for a million dollars or two million dollars or three million dollars.

Yeah.

It's just that we're in the financial sector, and we're going to ask one of our customers for this company's credit certificate because it's one card. You paid off your loan in one day, but we asked one of the cards for a notice as if they were paying you and your principal well for 30 or six months.

Yeah.

When that statement is attached, you're telling me that I'm going to trade it to the customer for $10 million for permission to buy this point.

Oh, but I'm going down like that, right?

No, it's not. No, it's not. Because you paid me back today.

Yes.

Then the ratings go up. And we're also going to rank them higher on our side. Victims 

Because now you don't have any payment, and you can't just touch your entire product on your own. Sir.

Oh, so if I pay you one thing, you'll get $8.00.

Yes, sir. Sir.

So if you pay me one today, I'll get it? Are you sure?

Yes, sir. Sir. But if you assume that all of your customers pay you $27 million, you can't get us the public notice we need if you call the Vienna Capital Center as you will.

Oh, yeah.

So we're going to call the Vienna Capital first.

Yes.

You're going to pay us back in this way, so the Vienna Capitol will give us this notice.

Yeah.

Would you like me to ask your client to hand you a handout after we ask for that notice?

Really? Yeah.

How are you going to clean up that Vienna Capitol?

Yeah. You said you'd definitely get 80 million?

I don't think you're worried about that, but I think you've got five and a half million dollars left to stay.

Yes.

So do you want me to make my request, as if you're taking out the next month's interest, and you want me to complete $27 million?

Yes. What do I do?

I'd like you to ask Mr. Kim Jae-sung to put that down. I'll call you back and I'll tell you to call me every representative of Mr. Kim. Sir.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir. Sir. Yeah.

"Oh, I'm the chief of the Vienneca Capitol bonds team.

Yes, thank you. Hello?

Yes, sir.

Yeah, I'm trying to pay you back.

Yeah.

Hey, did you get a request from the Agronoms?

I'll check your client's number for six front seats.

Yes, OOOOOOO

Yes, it's identified as OO's client.

Yeah, that's right.

Your client, he's using our advance.

Yes.

Yeah, I'm on my way to the Aethy Agronoms Central.

Yes.

My client's statement has become a receptionist.

Yes, I'd like to ask for a transfer request and a company application.

Yeah, we've got both of these.

Yes.

Do you have any idea what you're doing?

Yes.

Aren't you trying to get a mortgage loan from the farm?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's why I...

You know, if you're not in the financial sector, there's been a case where, through a consultant, you've gotten a new loan, you've gotten a new loan, you've got a better loan, and you've got this kind of loan.

Oh, yeah. I hope so.

Because the question you're asking is that in this kind of love-similar,

Oh, yeah.

That's why I've guided you. I said no to your client, so I asked you to sign the company subsidiate and I asked you to give me the full payment.

Yes. Oh, my God.

You have to do it, and we can send you a hearing after that.

Oh, okay, okay.

When you didn't get your client's payment, we...

What about the payment, then?

Okay, let's take you through the payment process from now on. Sir.

Yeah.

Yes, I'd like you to hold on for a moment.

Yeah.

Yes, hello.

Yes.

Yes, sir. And now he's on our side of the bank account.

Yes.

Yes, right now, you're entitled to a memo, right?

Yeah.

Two thousand seven hundred seventy-four thousand three hundred thirty-seven won.

Three hundred and thirty won? Yes.

Would you please send me the money?

Two thousand seven hundred seventy-four thousand three hundred thirty-seven persons.

Yes, and this is OO. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah. You're in charge of the corporate bank.

Yeah, that's right.

Yes, sir. Can you take your notes?

Yeah.

Business Banks

Yes.

OOOOOOOOOOOO, yes, sir. You're in charge of the Bank of Pusan for the lead account.

Yeah, that's right.

Because of your client's request, you've come in to collect your credit for our bond.

Yes.

I'm the one who's been assigned to take care of the accounts.

Oh, yeah.

Now is the time to call your account.

Yes.

I'm telling you, you're taking care of it in the morning on the Aethy farm.

Yes.

I've only got 15 minutes.

Yes.

'Cause we're gonna have to get him in 15 minutes right now.

Yes.

Would you please call us again?

Yes, sir.

Yeah, and what about how you're going to pay it?

That's the Internet deal.

Oh, you're a banger. You're an Internet banger.

Yeah.

Yes, the bank you're going to pay for is the company bank, right?

Yes, that's right.

It's your company bank, and it's 15 minutes old, so you're gonna have to pay for it, and you're going to have to contact them, and you're going to have to pay them for $27 million at a time.

Yes, sir.

Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

"Hello?

Hello?

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Nice to meet you. Now, um... All right, let's split up three times, and we'll pay for the car.

Yes.

At first, I'm going to give you a deposit after 20 million dollars.

Yes.

If you deposit the money, you'll buy a car for Mr. Pitt.

Yes.

(Beeping)

Yes.

You can pass it to our salesman.

Yes.

Yes, and the sales man is the most... There's another code sim we're dealing with.

Yes.

Go to that point and deliver the contract once again.

Yes.

(Beeps) You're going to have another centipede when you come to me.

Yeah.

An hour ago.

Yeah, I'm gonna go back to the farm farm and find the middle line.

Give it to my salesman.

Yes.

Now, at the end of the day, you're going to have 60 million won left, aren't you?

Yes.

At this point, when you and Mr. Pittt go in with our salesman, you're going to have to put in the starvation dealership as well.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, so that's where he bought the car, and the Puppy read the details.

Yes.

You can't sign that six million won to my salesman in that agency, in that dealer's office.

Yes.

Now that the agents at the agency are thinking about borrowing this, before we sign the contract, the salesman had to call her (pulls) for a moment.

Yes.

I'm going to give you six million dollars for it and I'm going to sign it. And that's when the purchase of the car ends.

Oh, yeah.

If it's 11 o'clock late, if it's 4 o'clock, it's 3 o'clock. So I'm asking you to clear your time at high time.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, well, sometimes some customers don't pay for it. But I can't make it back. What's missing is named after me. If you pick your grandfather or your reese, it's going to be a problem later on.

Yes.

Yeah, but I bought it for full cash and used the contract the day I bought it that day. Before signing the contract, God has ordered 10% of the car's price to be accepted.

Yes.

This is what it all ends up doing.

Uh-huh.

We usually buy a car for cash these days.

Yes.

If it's 10 days late, it's 12 days before it's out.

10 to 12 days.

On the day we're out, our sales people come down with us. Back to Busan.

Yes.

You're going to have to give me an hour and a half ago.

Yes.

Yes, there's a name here (Beep) and a car in front of us, but we're actually...

It's a company car. Hello? Hello?

Hello?

Yes.

That's the end of it.

Yes.

So, from Monday to Friday, it's a day between 11 o'clock and 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock.

Yes.

If you have a schedule, we're going to make a schedule, and our sales people are going to make a trip to Pusan.

Well, if you're going to proceed, you're going to have to... This Friday... Since when?

Hey, that's a five-day thing to eat.

Yes.

Yeah, well, it's a holiday, so you can't do it that day.

Yes.

It doesn't matter.

Oh, so next week... So, next Monday, April 9th...

Oh, so we're buying that car. We usually buy from one or six to seven in a day.

Yes.

It's full cash.

Yes.

I'm going to pick up 400 million, and I'm going to call you back to Katok on our schedule. We are.

Yes.

(Beeps)

Oh, I don't use katok alone.

Uh, uh... Well, then you should use a messenger.

Oh, my God. Just give me a minute, Katok. Hold on a second. So I'm just gonna put Katok on it right now.

Yeah, that's the phone number, Katok over there. Because. If you pay for that, I'm going to pay you for my first payment, and I'm going to give you my salesman.

Yes.

Then you're going to pay for the bank account.

Yes.

If you capture it and let it go, we're done with the contract for you. So now that he's sending you a double check and a balance, he's sending you up to six million dollars in commission, so you have to have a Katok Messenger.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Then it's katok.

Yes.

Uh, I'll call you in 15 minutes or 20 minutes.

Yes.

First of all, God is powerful on April 9th.

Yes.

Let's get a virtual reservation for the 9th.

Yes.

Yeah, and I'll call you back.

Yes.

Yes.

",,1
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, well, ask me what you're wondering.

Well, it turns out that it's different, and we're writing that account for the company, so why are we writing our own accounts?

I can't digest it all. We don't don't use it either. I'm writing. But it's now available to everyone who's doing it, and we're adding more to it to maximize revenue.

Oh, additionally.

Yes, sir. Now that we're in scale, it's a lot of money.

Yeah.

I'm trying to digest it more now, and I'm going to use it, as you said, as a company, and we're all going to use it.

Yeah.

Yeah, it's a turn-on, but it's an extra turn-on.

Externally?

Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

Yeah, well, if we return it to our account, then it'll be legal for money laundering.

Yeah, well, it's not money laundering, it's financial transactions. Yeah, that's right. But?

Yeah. Is this not gonna happen to us later in the legal system?

No problem. This is what I've told you, but you're over here and you're over here with your wallet.

Yeah.

It's not like you're giving it to a Korean wallet, or a Japanese wallet, or something like this. And because of the cashing, it's not like there's any evidence that Mr. Pitts, for example, are doing this.

Yeah.

For example:

Yeah.

That means that you have to make some kind of deal with the exchange.

Yeah.

That's why it's normal now to say that Mr. Pitt- you're going to deposit your money in your exchange account, and then you're going to have to pay him cash whatever you want, or whatever you're going to pay.

Yeah.

Yeah, it doesn't exist. So this is a normal trade. I'm not the one who hit you.

Well... It's not a blow. So, we're just, you know, I'm just gonna go and write my account?

That's right. We've been talking about, you know, sometimes when you're not in your name's account, you're like, Can't you just turn it off or anything else? We're putting money in there anyway. I'm going to put money into our company's transactions, for example, and Mr. Pittt -- now I'm going to bring my friend, my best friend, and I'm going to bring it in.

Yeah.

But the truth is, you can trust something, but you don't know money again. For example, we buy three bitcoins. And now I've sent you about 40 million dollars, and that's what happens at that moment in time, and that could happen again, and when that happens, it's a problem for the person, and it's a problem for the company. In fact, it's kind of vague to blame the beeper.

Yeah, that's right.

First of all, I'm in a position of damage, so I'm not sure if I'm going to work anymore.

Yeah, yeah.

We need to repair the damage, so we need to work again. You can't use that account again, you can't get into this mess. And that's why we talked about those parts at the beginning when I explained them, and we only use your current account.

Oh, so that's how we get paid, and then we cash it again. It's not illegal, it's not legal.

It's a little straightforward. There's an amygdala, which is something that you can't legally afford to do.

Mm-hmm.

Yes, I'm telling you clearly, but it's not illegal. It's a normal currency deal.

Yeah, and I was gonna be a visa, but I couldn't.

Yeah, well, the visa has to apply in the morning to get in that day.

Uh, so I was trying to figure this out today, but it's only in the morning?

You'll have to go by 10:11, but you'll be able to apply for that day.

Well, then who's out there?

We're gonna have our own staff out there.

Oh, you're taking me to the office now?

Yeah, yeah. Anyway, you're here anyway, and nobody's here, and you can't take a cab by yourself, and you can't even speak Chinese.

Yes, sir.

A powerful Korean employee is going to leave, and he's going to drag him out.

Yes, sir. Then I'll call you back in the morning.

Well, you're curious about something.

It has a 30-day visa and a 90-day visa.

I don't care. You can do anything. You ask me to do the cheapest thing I've ever done for a trip. If you come in here anyway, I've got that corporate company, and we're going to give you a job visa. If that happens while you're at work, well, then you get a job visa because there's a visa that you can go back and forth for a year at any time.

Yes.

Well, first of all, you just have to take the cheapest.

I'll let you know if there's anything else you don't know.

But just text me and, uh, I've got a lot of outside work going on these days, and the local staff we're working on right now.

Yeah.

I'm just saying that I've been interviewing local employees for a while.

Oh, yeah.

I'll call you as soon as I can if you text me.

Yes, sir.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Yeah.

Yeah.

",,1
"Yeah, well, is there any way I could have known that?

Uh, let me explain it a little bit first.

Yeah.

Uh, let me tell you why we're doing this.

Yes.

I don't know what you're talking about. I would've given it to you. Maybe. We have a couple of accounts at our place of exchange.

Yes.

There is. This account shouldn't exceed 2.2 billion. In a year.

Yes.

And on average, 30 million won a month.

Yes.

Two billion a year, that's more than the deal's worth.

Yes.

It's a lot of tax money.

Yes.

It's also a private account.

Yeah.

So in the old case, we've now written our parents's or cousins' or something like this. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Yeah. I borrowed so much, but I don't know what you know anymore.

Yes.

It's been six months, a year or so before, and it doesn't issue a bank notice.

Yes.

You have to have a legitimate reason to issue a report. Well, you have to go to work health insurance, or you have to go to tax paper.

Yeah.

There has to be something like this.

Yeah.

And now we have a lot of that sales that we can't digest. We are.

Yeah.

So now we've come up with a way, and we're going to pick out some employees and give them a little bit of time, and we're going to start with this.

Yeah.

But it's been a long time since we did this, but we haven't recruited as much as we do now.

Yes.

Yeah, you're on the phone now because we always check your account, and we're all giving you that note about all the money we've put in.

Yes.

So, you know, it's easy to say in a month, 2 billion a year, but you can look at 100 million that month. Yes. So we usually have to make sure that we don't over 100 million people a month. We are.

Yes.

Yeah, and I think you broke the law of exorcism.

Yes.

The violation of the foreign law should be reported to those who come to us for a humane exchange. I've had too many deals with the bank account, this one. When you check it, it's easy to say what's going on in the bank, or in the vault, when you can't put out your calling data about it, we're in a foreign country. Because you're waiting to come out, and you have to tell them that you've been transferred, and you can't just pull it out. This. You know, I used to pay for it in violation of the ex-conservation law. This was before. One more time. When you do it the first time. When I didn't know anything. But you don't have to worry too much about the same thing. Because now we're doing things with Nouhau and all that.

Yes.

That's why... If you really want to check it out tomorrow, you can talk to our client.

Yes.

But if you're too nervous now, the country's current number will give you a call if you ask us to call you.

Yeah, yeah.

But you don't have to worry about that.

But I don't go into the police station and this doesn't happen.

Oh, absolutely not. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And if you're really in trouble with synthetics, you're really in trouble. The phone can't be put in like this, so you can say that name.

Yeah.

It doesn't have to be from the bank.

And, really, this is how I'm supposed to be the one that I've now got a loan through my approach.

Yeah, yeah.

So what happens if I just get a deposit on this and I don't give it to you?

Now, if you don't give us a deposit, we're not going to get a cent of what we've been talking about.

Yes.

You told us about your birthday, you gave us your phone number, you gave us your account number, you gave it to the bank, you gave it all to our bank.

Yes.

This is the data that you gave us because you're working with us, right?

Yes.

If you took the money and ran it with you. We'll give this to our client.

Yes.

I'm sorry, this is your bank account, but I'm gonna need to make a phone call, and I'm gonna need you to stop paying me, and I'm gonna tell you how to do it. Because everyone who's going to the locals is going to give in.

Yes.

Not here, no country, no community, no community, no country, no country, no country, no country.

Yes.

Here. So if that happens, of course, we eat the bad. We can't just talk about renting someone else's bank account or something. Yes. We're gonna have to pay $80,000 for breaking the electronic financial deal.

Yeah.

But if you -- if you throw away this loan gun, you can't use a badge for that year.

Oh, yeah.

I can't do that for a year, and I can't do that, and I can't make a bank deal. So you can make a deal, and six months later, it's a deal, and now you can do it face-to-face in the window. Well, that's easy to say. That's possible.

Yes.

So what I didn't say to you now, at the beginning, is,

Yes.

I didn't say anything to threaten you with money.

Yes.

You don't need me to say this. Yes.

Yes.

It's the only thing that scares you.

Yes.

That's why I didn't tell you because I didn't have any paperwork.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

If this goes wrong, of course we're doing damage to it, but if you just talk about it over there, nothing's going to happen.

Mm-hmm.

So, as I said last night, we're not going to trade more than 30 million dollars at a bank, and we're not going to make any less than 1,500 dollars, and I've explained all of this to you, so you don't have to worry about that.

Yeah.

Are you worried?

I mean, there's a lot of them all over the country.

Oh, we've got a lot of people in Seoul, to be honest.

Yeah.

There's a lot on the side of Seoul, and there's only two of you in the Great War.

Yeah.

I'm not in the parking lot right now.

Just give me a minute. You can stay on the phone and come out for me.

Yeah.

Can you please come to the farmhouse at the base of the army? Make sure we find each other.

Wait a minute. Yes, please.

I'm just going to go to your farmhouse. Can you go?

Oh, you can do that.

Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Wait a minute. He's playing katok. What the hell? You're in the parking lot, you're in the parking lot? He's in front of the parking lot.

Oh, yeah?

I came to the front door.

He's wearing long, gray, long.

Gray long-falti?

I'll ask you a question.

Yeah, I didn't sign up.

"I don't think it's a fraud. We're guessing that we're victims of some personal theft, but we still have no evidence to prove that we're victims, so we're trying to help with the victim's test.

So first of all, it's going to be a wire rusting investigation, and it's going to be an important investigation for you to submit to the court instead, so when you're hearing behind it, or the voice in the third hand, it's not going to be adopted as a rusting statement, assuming that it's not a normal state, that it's stating it as someone's instructions or theft.

Yeah.

I've been briefing the case, but do you have any idea?

No, not at all. I've never lost anything.

Or you haven't noticed that you've been trying to log in or hack into someone else's social media account, or email account, or anything like that.

Yeah, and I haven't shown it to social media.

We need a few more calls now, but it won't take long, so can we move to a quiet place and ask for a statement?

Yeah.

We're going to be able to absorb the material we're looking at.

Where did you say you were?

I'm an officer in Seoul's G.I.I.I.E.O. Team Two. Are you alone, or are you quiet?

No, I'm alone.

Yes, and I'll keep telling you that.

Yeah.

For example, I'm going to go in and I'm going to go ahead and tell you a few things. Most importantly, it's important to you, so I'm going to ask you to answer without lying. The Bureau of Investigation has never requested a part of its identity number or account number, or a secret number, based on personal information protection laws.

Yeah.

If you don't follow this, don't say it yourself. You don't have to worry about it because I don't even ask for it.

Yeah.

In the analysis, if you know, you don't know, if you don't know, just give me the correct answer.

Yeah.

So let's start rusting. Can you please tell me your name so you can put it in the rust?

Yes, it is.

Do you know a 38-year-old man who lives in the light of the game?

No, I don't know.

Is it true that we've got a bank report from the third period of the month of 2017?

No, sir.

Did you know that Mr. H.

No, I didn't.

I mean, you didn't talk to Kim Shee-cheol in private, and you decided to get some extra financial benefits.

No, I didn't.

Once both of these cases were used criminally, they were frozen to prevent additional victims from occurring. Do you know what freezing is?

Oh, you've stopped him from using it anymore, haven't you?

That's right. Stop using crime to stop it from being used anymore and stop paying for it. In the case of residues in the account, we're limited by the end of the investigation.

Yeah.

Other accounts that occur in addition to your normal account, we'll take action to treat them in some cases, such as with the use of cannons, so that they can be frozen to the end of all investigations without further damage.

Yeah.

Now, we've found a bank in our bank and two banks, and we're going to filter out bank accounts that we haven't yet opened, and if you have a bank that you're using normally, we want you to make a brief statement about the bank's name.

The National Bank.

Are you using a private bank?

Yeah.

Do you have any other bank notes now that you've been issued and you don't use them?

No, sir.

If you do, in six months, if you don't have a deal, you'll be registered as a free account because of the latest shooting. There's a lot of cases where you don't care, so if you don't want to use it anymore, you can go to the point yourself.

Yeah.

First of all, you're only using one bank right now, and you're in line for your own account.

That's right.

I'm going to ask you, for example, how many accounts of your own account have been opened, and how many accounts are yours?

The national bank account is the president of the country and the country that the military has created when they get a physical check.

And you don't have an account from the National Bank?

Yes, that's all there is in the National Bank. One bank has a bank account that they don't use when they issue a student card.

Oh, so you're off school, or you're still in school?

He's in school, and he's about to get a job.

You're not using the Bank of the People's Republic of China or the Bank of England anymore, are you?

Yeah.

That's what I'm gonna let you know.

Yeah.

And now you're using those two accounts, just those two right now, using the U.S. military department as your love card and your country's bank card?

Yeah.

And now we're going to finally make sure that we have a depositor bank deposit, and, uh, we have a national bank and a bank right now, and we're going to have a bank, and we're going to have a bank, and we're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank, and you're going to have a bank account, and you're going to have to have a bank account account, and you're going to have a bank account bank accounts, and you're going to have a bank account, you're going to have a bank accounts, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you know, you know, you're going to have a bank accounts, you know, you know, you're going to have a bank accounts, you know, you know, you're going to have a bank accounts, you know, you know, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have a bank accounts, you're going to have bank

Banks don't check, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know over a year, and they have about $130,000.

Yes, sir. In a bank, if you don't continue to use it, you might want to pause it.

Yeah.

In school, especially now, when it comes to school, when I'm a student registration or whatever, because I can leak enough of my personal data through the club, it's very likely that I'm using a long-term bank account as a secretary of the cannon. And that's why you always pay attention to that.

Yeah.

Once we're done with a simple investigation, and we're going to be able to do that in your name, and then we're going to be able to go to each other, so if you're going to call again, don't miss it.

Yes, sir.

"I'm Tim Doyoung, a financial criminal investigation team. (Beeps) Are you right?

Yes.

Do you know of a 40-year-old woman named Kim Yeo-sun, from Xon-nam Masan?

No, I don't. I don't know.

Did you have two presidents of the Bank of South Korea and the National Banks of South Africa opened at the Medows in South Majung, in about the 16th of January of the year?

No, sir.

No, because the two officers were found at the illegal scene, they were frozen without his consent. Do you know what freezing means?

No, can you explain?

Yes, freeze processing is no longer being paid off for illegal funds. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about the financial sector to verify this because it's a situation where you have an additional account that you don't know about in addition to the two accounts that you have received. Before I ask you a question, the Bureau of Investigation does not require any personal or financial information.

Yeah.

Please recognize this point and answer something. Uh, tell me about your bank notes or whatever you're using.

Aggressive and private banks.

Agrosss and the National Bank.

Yeah.

Well, you have to tell me about the enemy bank notes you created.

You mean the area?

Yes.

You mean the area?

No, I'm asking you to tell me everything about the bank.

No, I don't.

So how many accounts do you have in this bank?

We've got two on the farm.

Some sort of thing.

It's a check card.

I'm going to have to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get in and I'm going to get out of here.

Yeah, but it's another one of those, and it's a deposit, too.

Both of you have a deposit?

Yeah.

The National Bank.

That's a deposit, too, with a traffic card.

Oh, yeah. Well, there's no such thing as a savings deposit minus a depositor.

No cash. I don't know if there's something you're gonna give your mother in my name.

Well, I don't know, because that's the most dangerous part of it, so there's no way to identify the Agronoms or the people.

It's all over the app.

Well, let's just check it out.

Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

Yes.

I think it's gonna take a while. Are you all right?

How long will it take?

This is what we just found.

Just slow down.

This isn't Boys Pissing, is it?

So, what can we do to help you identify that?

I've never seen anything like this before.

Yes, sir.

How do we make sure of something?

What do you mean?

I'm in an agronomous app.

Yes, sir.

Didn't you tell me to check on something?

Well, that's how much money we're going to pay, because lastly, we're going to have to check the amount for account registration. Yeah, well, if you'd like to know how much you have on the bank account, I'd like you to tell me how much money you've got on the bank, or roughly how much money you've got on the bank.

Excuse me.

Yes.

One has about $87.

less than 100won, for example.

Yeah, one more thing.

Hello?

It's about a thousand dollars. I think there's another bowel.

Yeah, what happens to that?

I think it's 20 bucks.

Yeah, that, too. So you're saying it's less than $200 for all three.

Yeah.

The Bank of the People of China.

I can't confirm that, but it's probably less than 50 won.

Maybe your parents don't know what's coming in, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on?

Yeah.

Have you heard anything about it?

But now that I've identified it in my name, I don't think my mother put it in my name.

You don't know?

Once we're done, we'll talk to them, we'll check them out, and if it's tens of millions of dollars away, we'll call them back, and we'll go back and do another survey. If you don't, we'll close the negatives here.

Yes, sir.

Yeah, you don't have to worry too much. I'll call you back when the case is over.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir. Thank you.

"I'm working on an alternative loan right now. But we're not in Busan. We're working in Seoul's Canon, we're doing our job, we're doing our job on the side of the mountain. And that's why we have to do that, because if we keep talking to our customers on the phone, we're not doing anything with the credit department and the alternative part. That's why we're working on it now at the Great Mount.

Yeah.

Customers, the receptionist did this with you as a receptionist, but you're not going to decide if you're going to do it yourself, you're not going to have a bank.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Right? Well, we'd like you to know that your credit loan agency is a credit agent's transfer record, so we'll talk to the registered customers, we'll talk to them, we'll talk to them, we'll talk to them, we'll talk to them, we'll talk to them about where they're going to take you, but when you're authenticated, we'll take you to the home office. It's only then that you can see it. But that's something you can check out, but it's not something you can check in time. Yes, and we're going to be able to verify that you're authenticated and proceed, and you can check this if you call the head office tomorrow.

I mean, I know this is because I'm late, but is there any way that we can find out?

Not at this time.

I mean...

I'd like you to tell me quickly, but I'm telling you, we're going to tell you that we're going to take the official document to Russie and Kathy, and we're going to pay you back, and we're going to pay you the monthly interest, the trade maintenance, and the rent code, and we're going to pay you back.

I'm sorry, is there any fax or anything I can get? There's a fax that you can see.

I don't know about faxes. I'm going to give it to my client, but we're not going to be able to fax these parts out. We don't have money, you're not out. When we do this, we get contact from the government support department because it's government funding. Then I'm the only one who can deal with discipline. If it's part of the job you're doing to your customers, you'll have to check it out tomorrow. If that's where I'm going to give it to my client, I'll check it out, but I'll tell you one more thing.

Yeah.

If you suspect that the customer is not $90, it's $5 million.

Five million won. Yeah.

No, sir. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about.

No, it's $5 million, because we checked it in Russie and Kathy. That part's over. That part's over. That's how I know if I'm going to dump nine hundred thousand won in the middle, for example. I got a card loan now, with someone else's consent.

Yeah, but I'll tell you what.

Yeah.

What are you talking about?

No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to doubt it.

No, no, no. You can do that from your point of view.

Because I once had my father's mother.

Oh, I know that's what you're doing, but...

Yeah, that's it.

I'll tell you as much as I can about what I can say to reassure you. I can't help it. If it's something we can show you right now, we can definitely show it to you.There's nothing there. I'm sure of it. I can't help it. I can't help it. I'd like to fax it all to my clients, but I can't do that. Instead, I can assure you that 1.8 million people don't have a reason for dressing up. Because we took rush and Kathy, and they took care of her, and they did everything.

Yeah.

And they're all confirmed.　If you're on our side of the scam, there's nothing you can do about it. And we asked him to check it out as soon as he was ready. No, we're grateful to you because as much as you can, your individual calls to your office, and you misconstrues it, so that you take customers away from yours, so that you can get the best out of them, so that we can check out what we've been doing, so you've returned to your account, right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

We checked it all out with the government. If you've identified the part where Russie and Kathy have been organized, you wouldn't have done that without our help. Do you? You're right. Because we've paid the interest rate, we've paid for the power control code, we've paid for the trade. You're right, aren't you? Without our help, we can't clean up for you, Mr. Russian and Kathy. But you got settled. And that means that you don't have to worry about $908. Your client paid you five million won, didn't he? Have we ever demanded that part of it sooner or later? Have you asked for anything and done anything?

Sir?

No, I didn't do that. Yeah.

Yeah, that's right. And you know, of course, that there's a middle-line payment fee or something like this. I'd like you to make a loan.

That's right.

That's right. You don't pay for that, do you? We paid you. And you said clearly that you've cleaned up Russie and Kathy? You said you checked, sir.

No, I mean, you know, after seven o'clock,

Yes, sir.

I called right away, and I couldn't hear from her, so I couldn't get back to her. I called you and you didn't answer your phone. So from my point of view, I just had to think that I was a little bit disappointed.

So you're right. How am I supposed to talk to you? And I'm telling you about the part, and I'm suddenly informed, and I'm suddenly going down to the final. And then I went down, and I couldn't tell my ex-wife to do the phone call, and now I'm taking care of it, and I'm up there.

First of all, yes, sir.

You understand that, don't you? And Russie and Kathy, they only told you about your loan, five million won. Well, since we've been working on this, you're handling this. You said you checked this part. Do you understand? So, we've also paid the rent, the monthly interest cost, and we've paid seven million dollars for that. You've got nine hundred and eighty... You're right. You're only paying $80,000.

Oh, do you mind if I tell you that I'm a goddess and I tell you the name of my counselor?

Uh, you can check it tomorrow.

Oh, yeah? Oh, yes, sir.

Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow. It's morning. Yeah, it's about nine to ten.

Yeah, yeah.

I'll call you back then and help you with your progress, sir.

Oh, yes, sir.

But think about it. The reason why you didn't suspect this part of the story was because you confirmed that you did it yourself.

But it's because Russie and Kathy don't use anything that's been in my bank account this year, and yes, I'm here today, right?

You took care of that loan. But again, even if you get paid right now, and you get paid back, and you get canceled, you're still dealing with the cost, the power control code, the monthly interest cost, and so forth. Middle-term payment fee.

Yeah.

You're the client because we paid for that? If you didn't, you won't be able to clean it up, sir. I'm sure you haven't done your loan once or twice, but you know that this is what happens, right? We paid you this part, so your client's done it.

Oh, I wish I had one on this side today.

Oh, I can't help it with time.

Yeah.

Think about it, too. You can think about it simply. I mean, you've been worried about this because you've been having a little bit of a storm since seven o'clock, and now that you've had some of those accidents, you've been a little bit worried about it, but if you think simply, you'll get the answer. If you want to clean up Russie and Kathy, of course, you have to add the rest of the deal. Did you pay for that, or did you take care of me, and then I took care of it, and it all came to an end, and you checked all the stuff that's been done by Russie and Kathy?

Yeah, I see what you're talking about. You're gonna have to get out of here fast.

Don't worry.

You'll have to call me tomorrow.

No, I've been called a fraud.

You've been cheated? What fraud?

I told the police that I had been lied to for a while.

You called the police? What have you been cheated on?

They said it was used as a cannon.

Yours? What happened to you?

Yeah, well, the agent knows that.

You don't have an agent, but you're here today.

You've been dismissed today?

He offered me a loan yesterday and led me into a bank account deal.

The bank account? Did you give him the badge?

No, I didn't give you that badge, but it didn't work out, so you had to get a deal if you wanted to.

So if he gets a deposit to get that deal, he'll pay for it...

Did your client send you a deposit?

Yeah.

He told you to give it to the extraction team?

That's why you gave me the money? How much?

You said you were out of work.

When I thought I was right to tell you that I was out of work, what did you say at the police station?

I've called it off, sir.

You're being punished, aren't you?

I haven't done that yet, so let's just wait. I'm a victim in a way.

But even if he was a victim, you gave him the money, didn't you?

I did? I talked to the police there, and they asked me to wait.

I don't know if you're going to the police station and you're gonna pay for this, but you're going to jail.

So he asked me to wait first.

There's been a report. What about it?

Yeah, that's why I went to work with the police.

"Hello?

Hello, sir. Can you do that?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm the trade director.

Yeah.

Can you tell me where you live and how old you are?

With Seoul. Resident area?

Seoul? How old are you?

Twenty-six.

What else are you doing here?

No, I'm not working.

Now, I don't know if you've ever seen Ton, but we've got a company that exports tea and used cars overseas, and there's lots of stores and dealers in used cars, so we've got nothing to worry about.

Yeah.

If they send them out of modern hunger, they'll get their own revenues, and because we're on the sidelines, the contractors are in trouble, and they're in trouble, aren't they?

Yeah.

But we can cancel this contract, which is kind of the other way around.

Oh, no.

So there are some people who are taking the commission to buy, and they're doing it for me, and if you look on the Internet, you'll see that they're doing it for you.

Yeah.

Excuse me.

Yeah.

I'm not asking you to pull your own car, but I'm telling you, there are a lot of them, and you need to take care of them.

Yeah.

In the old days, they don't have the money, so I have to pay them to buy a car.

But I can't give you any money, because if you give your customers anywhere between $3,500 and $4 million, and they eat you up, we get a little nervous.

So in the past, if you were to take a car in front of a Hong Gil-dong customer and export it, if you got it all, you'd get it from here, and you'd get it back to Hong-gil, and you'd give it to the sales people.

I can't do that anymore, and I'm just checking to make sure that this is really the money of the Honggilo customer, so we get a card from the customers, and we're going to go in there, and we're going to deposit it, and then we're going to send it to the sales office, and then we're going to send it all by their name.

You can't come three times on the day of the contract, so on the day you're out, you'll have to come anyway, so you'll have to come, but you can't do that before that, so you'll send me in on a train.

Well, you know, when you get out, you go to the bank, you go to the bank, and you do this, and it seems easier to talk, but there's a lot of left-wing stuff.

What kind of...

There's a lot of people in the shipping business who manage the contract, so just think that you're gonna have to keep putting these things in there, and you're gonna have to take care of the cleaning business from the outside.

Where is your home in Seoul?

So let's say that this is the side of the bacteria.

Then you'll be waiting at the nearest train station in the morning, and you'll be on the boat, and you'll be able to take it directly from your client, and then you'll have a card...

Yeah.

If you're waiting, let me know when the buyer is going to deposit, then you'll be on your way, then you'll be on your way, you'll be on your way, you'll be on your way, you'll be on your way, you'll be on your way... He's not a bank. He's traveling.

Oh, yeah.

So it's kind of hard to move at first. It's better for you to move than to wait.

Where are we moving?

You keep moving to more and more banks, and you're seeing your work.

Can't one bank do it?

So if the monitoring is duplicated, you're gonna have to do four or five monitors a day, and then you're not gonna make sure what's getting out of that bank.

Oh, no.

So you've started your shift today, and you've got to go to the new station this afternoon, and you've got to pick up your shift, and you've got to pick up your shift, and you've got to pick up your work, and you've got to come over and see what you're doing, and you've got to do.

Yeah.

And in the case of Fay, you're going to decide for yourself what the total amount of money you're going to pay is 1.Some of you get five percent, some of you get one percent of your total money, some of you go for $60,000.

Oh, 60 base gold?

Yeah, and I don't pay for it.

What then? How?

Think about it, Mr. Eck has all the cards, so if you have $20 million today, then 1.If it's five percent, if it's $300,000 a day, 20 million a day, and if it's a ticket, it's about 1950, and if it's 50 in your pocket, then at night you're going to have 50 left, and you're going to take 300,000 today, and you're going to hand over 50 dollars to the porter.

The rest of you when you're on your way home, you're gonna put it in your kitchen and you're gonna take it back the day.

Nothing hard to do, right?

First of all, you're a little lost for a couple of days.

To be honest, you've got kids in elementary school who don't know if you've ever signed up.

Yeah.

If you're old or old, you've lost a lot of people, but it's repetition anyway.

It would be nice if you stayed long enough, but if you're gonna be short, you'll have some money.

So I've been able to do this since the 29th? I've got a little bit of work to do right now.

I don't care, but she said that, so before you do, you need to call me again and call me back.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'll call you back.

"You can assume that you've seen an outside interest position where you're paying our clients back and re-registering our company.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

You're working for your fund management. Oh, well, he usually goes to work, and then he goes to work.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

But you can usually think of it as 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., but you can think of it as 10 1/2 a.m. I wrote it a little bit earlier, it's 10 o'clock, but it's a little bit more relaxed than 10 o'clock in the morning.

So where are you supposed to go to work?

Now that we're on the ground, we usually have our own customers. It depends on where we're going. It's all over Seoul.

Uh-huh.

The place you come to work that day is different.

Uh-huh.

But these days, I've been in Seoul and I've been in Seoul for an hour and a half, and I've been there for a while and a half.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, well, you don't have to come into your office, and you look at all your work on the ground, and you think you're going home from work.

And then there's a couple of places a day that look like this.

It's not just a few places, we're assigning customers. I'm not going to go to a company or I'm going to assign my customers to them, and they're usually going to be assigned to one or two people a day, and then they're going to take back my company, and they're going to have three of them in a day. It's not going to happen that much.

But what's the company doing?

Oh, we've got some of you in the business now. It's a company where people in business are now making deals, and they're being paid to do that.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Yeah, well, that's what they're gonna do for us, and it has nothing to do with the OO, but you don't have to do it on your own because of the sales and sales department anyway.

Oh, yeah.

We're usually on our side, and now we're dealing with people who've been trading this steadily for five or even ten years.

Oh, yeah.

Now, the reason they're asking us to do business is because OO wouldn't have done business alone.

Yeah.

You know, business people are now calling you rich taxes.

Oh, yeah.

So, this quarter, you've got a little low cash sales, and some of you are trying to make money higher.

Uh-huh.

Or there are people who are trying to sell business to someone else, who are trying to sell it and get some more rights.

Uh, yeah, I get it. So let's say...

It's very useful for people in business, so we don't get involved in it.

Yes.

Well, if you could ask the bank what kind of relationship this guy is, just tell them he's your brother and he's your brother.

Yeah.

What are we doing here for so much cash? ""Because of my husband's business,

Yeah.

I borrowed some money from you.

Yeah.

Well, it's business money.

Yeah.

You go into the bank, and then there's another one. I mean, we're gonna deposit our money and we're gonna transfer it to that post office, right?

Yeah.

Well, give me your first call.

Yeah.

And then, actually, my teacher is another expert on teaching students. Right?

Yes.

We also know that we're professional.

Yeah.

I'm going to ask you to go somewhere else as soon as I can today, and if you can, you can follow me.

Yeah.

Anyway, I need you to call me again before you go into the bank. Because now our clients have paid off.

Yeah.

We've registered this and now we can't get in touch with him and OO, and then our clients come in again, and why don't I check it out?

Yeah.

Well, maybe we can do this, or maybe we should call a lot of times.

Yeah.

So now, before you go into the bank, a phone call.

Yeah.

And then I went into the bank.

Yeah.

I went into the bank, and I couldn't get in touch with this, and I had a bank window employee. You don't even ask. Yes. So, if you go into the bank, we won't call you. Because you said you'd go in.

Yeah.

But what's going on now is that there's more people in the bank than there are people in the bank.

Yeah.

There may be lots of people waiting, and sometimes there won't be any more. Yes.

Yeah.

So for example, there's more than one dozen people, nine or more, and if you think you're going to wait a little bit, you could just call me while you're in the bathroom, and you're going to be in the bathroom, and you're going to be in the bathroom, and you're going to be in the bathroom, and you're going to be in the bathroom, and you're going to be in the bathroom, and you're going to be in the bathroom, and you're going to be in the bathroom.

Yeah.

I just need you to come out and call me, and I'm gonna have to wait a little longer on my own. You can call me.

Yeah.

If you don't have a lot of people in your window, then you can just look at the work and come out. And if you come out and tell me, for example, that I found some money and some fees, then I'm going to have to work with the real-life worker.

Yeah.

Where's the employee at the same time? Go somewhere, or I'll send an employee there anyway, depending on the current situation,

Yeah.

I'll make you something. Don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

Yeah.

But you're going to have to look at your work in the same way that you do, but sometimes you're going to have a window worker doing something like this. And since this is actually where the OO works, we can't do anything about it. You can't ask her any more questions, so...

Yeah.

The important thing is that we're going to do some of this stuff tomorrow, so it's going to be Monday. Monday day.

Yeah.

Now, on Monday, we're going to take a loan from the city's side.

Yeah.

I need you to give me some clarity to work on that part.

Yeah.

You just need to clean up your work a little bit.

Yeah.

Yeah. Now, I'm going to register you for the transfer.

Yeah.

Uh, at least if you're a bit of a depositor, please give me a call.

Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.

And I think it might be 30 minutes, or maybe you'll be in the car listening to some music, and then you'll have to put off your personal business a little bit after four o'clock.

Oh, well, I'm going to have to go back to farming.

Yeah, well, if that's the case, you're being promoted as an agross, and the security media is a security card, or is it OTP?

That's my security card.

I've been able to make stuff out of my childhood, and I've never used it, and it's not like that, because it's time and it's time? I had him go straight to the guardhouse to check on the money on January 12, 2015.
 I'll give it to you, but she'll tell you, there's a small one, you know, you can't come to work on Thursday, you can't buy chicken. Well, first of all, because of me, I'm not going to let you know about that anymore. So since we can't talk more about it right now, we're going to have a third party carry it around. So press with your power. We're going to submit the first one to the court on that road, and the second one through the uniform.
 What do you think it's worth when you're locked in a national card? I'm gonna check the accounts for the bank account. I'm gonna ask you a few questions about the trip, and I'm sorry, but where are you at? Or you're out of time, and I'm going to be the phone bill from now on, and I'm going to make it worse, so I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm going to do.
 If you're going to tell me something else, then I'll be at the airport from now on. If it's money, you know it or you don't know it, no, no, no. By that time, the main school, January 12, 2015, was in the pool from January 3 to 6th. What about the two cages?
 Do you agree, do you have any items that have not been checked for anyone who has not sent you a wallet or an I.D.? You can use it in your current location. I'm going to tell you, and you're going to do it for the car guy.
 Maybe you're using it? When you got paid, you grew up, and when you got paid, you moved it from the terminal to the card there, so what did you do with two? Oh, I can hear you, but what am I doing?
 I'll do something right now. No, it's okay. You know, I've been talking about it, and I've been looking for it, and everybody's talking about it, and who's telling me about it?
 If you're supposed to do something like this, I'm going to go now.
 You know this, Mr. Kim Hyun-chul. Do you do that? I'm sure you'll meet and take the story with you right now. Check it out.
 I'll do it in love, and if you can't do it today, you'll do it again, but instead, I did it when I went, and you and I are working at the bank.
 So, let's just say you have a new bank and you can do it. For example, $30,000, $100,000, $120, $45. It's a cash card, so I think it's going to cost me $200 right now. Then you run the mode so far.
 We're going to record it from now on. If, for example, you have the same situation and you can get in again, that's not the case. That's why I'm gonna call you back, and it's gonna be over, so note me again.
 I'm gonna send it to you because you don't have any contact. I'll see if you can check it out and see if you can check it out. I'm going to send you the backbook to see if it's over, and if you have any parts, I think you'll be right there.
 There's a couple of guys there, and I'm reminded of one thing, and I've got a photo boyfriend from 2009 to 10 years, and there's no weird guy, and I don't know what he's saying, but he's in his car, and he's been doing it a long time ago, and I don't know how to think about it, but I don't know how I saved it, but I don't know.
 I'm thinking he might have a name or something, so I'm gonna ask him if he shouldn't go too far, and he's a scary guy, so don't worry about what he's like, but he's gonna be really, really hard at the time.
 There's someone who's really scary right now, and you can't just come home and do it again. I've done all this stuff, so don't do it, because I don't know what's going to happen, it's going to be OK, it's going to be known, it's going to be both of you, don't worry, it's going to be today.

They have a full-time account at the health scene, and they're now listed, including an agricultural account by the Bank of the People's Bank. Do you know anything about the National Bank? Where do we live for selling and loaning?

He's been in three days, and he's been in his own bank account, and he's getting 20 million dollars from the middle to Bosp Singh, and he's doing it together as an accomplice because he's on his way.

Everything on the phone will be melted down and the evidence will be in the case investigation. I'm on my way to the question.

Have you ever been a recently used guide and been able to import money that you don't know? I don't know.

You're using Internet banking telebanking smart banking, all three of which you don't use for dinner. Do you get a text notice of the deal's history?
