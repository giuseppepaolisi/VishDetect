"I actually contacted the Central District Prosecutor's Office regarding the intelligent crime investigation. By any chance, what is your relationship? They are working among friends called Spring. These days, they are studying, so what are you talking about? We have more on our side.",0.845971465,1
"Hello, this is the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. If you need to contact again, can we talk? Yes, is this the person from Gwangju, Jeollado, who goes by the name Kyung? No, there isnât anyone like that. Why are there so many calls coming from Eun Hee-kyung? Not long ago, they had a basis for contacting me at the aquarium. I contacted them because I realized this was connected to my bank account. Whatâs important is that when we checked, it was about an hour apart in Gyeonggi-do, Gwangmyeong. Are you confirming this yourself? Itâs completely gone. Hello? If so, do we actually have anything that was issued? If not, while commuting, are there items like your wallet or ID that could leak personal information? Iâve found out some facts from the Financial Supervisory Service, and it has been confirmed that yes, among those involved in this case, there were people whose names were misused, directly involving Moon Hee-kyung and others from the Yangsan Terminal. Today, in the deposit settings, if I receive contacts coming to my account, whether they guide me or I confirmed my identity at the stop before the priest got the body check. I will contact you.",0.879500687122345 0.892507791519165,1

"Hello? Yes, hello. Yes, this is Manager Park Cheol-min from the Customer Service Department. Yes, is this Mr. OOO, the customer? Yes, I heard you were looking for Assistant Kim Sang-hoon. Yes, I received a call earlier. Yes, what was the reason for your call, customer? I was just wondering how things were going. Um, what are you trying to do, customer? I was wondering how to handle things. Is it about the documents? Yes, processing, the processing part? Yes, the processing part. Ah, then first of all, I apologize since I did overturn something to some extent earlier. Customer, to be honest, Assistant Kim Sang-do is also a branch employee of ours. Heâs a branch employee but there has been some inappropriate dealings between you and him, which has made me somewhat upset, and that is why I wanted to contact the person in charge to provide some guidance. To be honest, I'm also worried about that part. Since he is working at our branch, and thereâs this risk of him potentially losing his job, you being concerned about the loan funds is certainly valid. However, this part, if it goes up to the headquarters, our branch's image will also suffer. Yes, thatâs why I wanted to help you as much as possible, which is why I contacted you. But you keep discussing just the funds... We need to find a solution to resolve this. We have to find a way to ensure that you can accurately receive your funds, and the person in charge is aware that he is currently a financial company employee. He is aware of this, yet he still proceeded with these actions, so I think within our branch, he will face some consequences. Yes, yes, regarding that part, if I may guide you, if you want to avoid this issue from going up to the headquarters, this document hasn't been sent to the headquarters yet. Yes, the increase in your transfer card is something you have paid for, right? You're aware that the relevant legal representative knows about the two paid transactions already. However, I am currently confirming this, and I've put a delay on it. You need to get a new transfer card issued concerning the amount of 4 million won that you previously had with inappropriately made payments. Since you currently have issues with inappropriate payments, thereâs little I can do to cover this up. Therefore, you need to have the transfer card reissued, and then ensure that there were no inappropriate transactions. The transfer of 4 million won that you made regarding your transfer card, this should be refunded together with the total of 27 million won that should be going out from us, right? You need to receive it as 31 million won. Itâs not 27 million, right? What do you mean? Itâs 31 million, but isnât it 27 million? The 27 million won is for the loan funds, and in this case, you need to secure the refunds for the improperly made payments with the total coming to 31 million won. How much is that? Does it go higher? What do you mean? Do I have to pay 400,000 won more then? If you want me to handle this neatly, it would be best to process the reissuance of the 400,000 won portion concerning the transfer card increase. Yes, you know this part, customer. I checked, and you had some difficulties when proceeding with the loan. The person in charge covered some payments for you, right? Please just process that, and I will head down to the reissuance department to process it. After that, I will issue the re-issued cards reflecting your full payment, and anyway, there wonât be any issues regarding your residential area or anything. You can then handle the processing again afterwards. Yes, yes, then just process the payment made by the person in charge, and I will inform the relevant legal representative that there were no inappropriate payments while reporting that the transfer card was reissued. Then, I would have to pay an additional 1.5 million won, is that right? Thatâs right. Just process the card reissuance for the payments covered by the person in charge. Those inappropriate transactions will be refunded back to you. What do I do though? I donât have the money. Ah, customer, the minimum amount I can cover for you in this case is for the inappropriate transaction by the person in charge, which you need to process yourself. If that doesnât happen, thereâs really nothing we can solve from our side, customer. I will just call you back later. How long can we delay this? I need to rewrite the documents to avoid punishment, and the person in charge will inevitably face reductions in salary or missed promotions at the branch level. But first, your loan funds are more important, right? You need to let me know how long I should hold this up. I need to communicate with the legal team regarding this. I need to explain everything, and if the legal representative directly makes a request to the headquarters, then unfortunately, I wouldnât be able to cover this thing up. Then I will try to find a way as soon as possible. So, Iâll place a delay until lunchtime. Just until noon, if you contact me through your person in charge, make sure to let me know immediately. Is lunchtime until 1:00 or 1:30? Lunchtime is until 1:30, customer. Understood. Alright then. Yes, yes.",,1

"The first thing is, our customer, now we are collecting articles only from you, and it seems like we are taking away existing customers. Therefore, if you request a direct situation, you might be able to ask if people came through NH Nonghyup. If you do so, please mention that my cousin works at NH Nonghyup and that I am handling this for credit management purposes. You need to explain this well. First of all, you need to make a request, and it will take about an hour and a half. We need to take our time slowly. Thatâs the first point. Secondly, you need to request a proof of payment for the records. The handling of this is supervised in a way that is confirmed with the Financial Supervisory Service, our NH Nonghyup, and the counterpartâs financial institution, Moa Savings Bank. The escrow account is not just for ordinary people; if you ask how this works, you should mention that my cousin works at Nonghyup, as that part might not be processed. We are providing assistance in this indirect way, so customers should not be upset, and even if they say something over there, I have to do this, and you have to go out to make it happen.",0.91159588098526 0.8852831721305847,1
"Yes, yes, yes. Please ask whatever you're curious about. So, originally, I found out from somewhere else that you use a corporate account, but why are we using a personal account? I can't fully understand that. It's not that we don't use it at all. We are using it. But there are people who handle that separately, and we are trying to maximize profits, so you can think of it as adding more to that. Oh, additionally? Yes, since we are now reaching a certain scale, financially, we are trying to handle more of it now. As you mentioned, we also use the corporate account to handle that. Yes, yes, we handle that, and aside from that, we are handling more externally. Externally? Yes, you understand what I mean, right? Yes, so if we rotate it through our account, legally, that would be considered money laundering, right? Well, to put it simply, it's not so much money laundering as it is, well, financial trading, right? Yes, that's right. But? Yes, later on, legally, will we not get caught? There won't be any problems. As I mentioned, the coins transfer from here to an electronic wallet, right? Yes, and then you transfer it to either a Korean wallet or a Japanese wallet like that. Since it's being monetized from that state, honestly, for example, there is no evidence that (bleep) did any currency exchange from a certain place. Yes, for example, yes. There needs to be a record that there was a transaction with the currency exchange agent, and only then can it be considered normal. Yes, there needs to be a record of (bleep) depositing a certain amount into the currency exchange account, and then receiving a certain amount in cash from that person, right? Exactly. Yes, that record doesn't exist. So, this is a normal transaction. It's not a currency exchange. Hmm... Itâs not a currency exchange. So, do I have to use my account regardless? That's right. As long as itâs not a personal account in your name, well, sometimes people ask if they can use their mother's or relative's account. But we are putting money into those accounts after all. We are depositing company transaction funds there. For example, if (bleep) brings in a friend's or close friend's account. Yes. But, it's said that you can trust them, but money is something you can't know for sure. For instance, if we say to buy 3 bitcoins and then send about 40 million won, how do you know something might happen to that person in that moment, leading to an incident? If that happens, both parties and the company would be in trouble. In fact, it would be a bit ambiguous to hold (bleep) responsible for it. Yes, that's right. Since they are the one causing the loss, it would be awkward to continue working. Yes, yes. We have to recover the lost amount, so we have to keep them working. We cannot use that account, and it becomes a complicated situation. Therefore, we've explained since the beginning that we only use the accounts of current employees. Oh, so after we receive that money and buy, then we cash out, that's not illegal nor is it legal, right? It's somewhat of a loophole. There are some loophole aspects, but legally, there cannot be any sanctions on that. Hmm. Yes, I can clearly tell you that it is not illegal. It's a normal currency transaction. Yes, and also, I was going to apply for a visa earlier, but it didnât work. Yes, yes, the visa application has to be submitted in the morning if you want it to go through that day. Oh, so I was going to resolve it today, but it can only be done in the morning? You probably need to go by 10 or 11 AM for that dayâs application to go through. Hmm. So, who will be picking me up? Someone from our staff will come to pick you up. Oh, so they will take me into the office? Yes, yes, yes. Anyway, you came all the way here, and you canât just take a taxi by yourself without anyone here, especially since you can't speak Chinese. Yes, yes, someone who can speak Korean will come and take you. Yes, I understand. Then I will contact you again tomorrow morning via KakaoTalk. What are you curious about? I've heard there's a 30-day visa and a 90-day visa. Hmm, it doesnât matter; you can choose either. Just ask for the simplest and cheapest one for travel. Since when you come here, I have a corporate company, so we will issue you a work visa. During your working time, after that, if you obtain a work visa, you will have a visa that allows you to come and go at any time for a year. Yes, so you can just get the cheapest one. Hmm, okay, I will contact you if I have any other questions. But please send me a message first as I've been busy with external tasks, and we are currently hiring local staff. Yes, yes. I've been going back and forth for local staff interviews. Ah~ If you send me a message, I'll try to call you back as soon as possible. Yes, understood. If you have any questions, please reach out. Yes. Yes.",,1
"Hello? Hello? Yes, yes. Ah, yes, the results for you have come out. Yes, yes. Ah, right now, our limit is 9,300 and it's at 2.6%. Ah, yes, this is primarily a virtual result from our side. Yes, yes.

Ah, yes, yes. The primary examination has been completed, and for this secondary examination, there are some parts you need to apply for directly. Yes, yes. Yes, I will explain that part to you, and thereâs no need for you to write it down. Ah, yes, I will read it out to you. Yes, yes. First, you don't have any problems using a computer, right? Yes, yes. Then if you search for the Korea Asset Management Corporation on Naver or Daum, KAMCO will come up. Yes, yes. Go there and create an electronic credit report. Yes, yes. Once it's completed, you need to register your certificate as a customer. Yes, yes. Are you currently using a certificate? Yes, yes. Ah, which bank's certificate are you using? It's from Woori Bank. Ah, currently it's from Hana Bank. Yes, yes. The certificates you can register with us are from NongHyup and IBK, only these two. Ah, then I guess I'll need to get it reissued from NongHyup. Yes, yes, then please get it issued from NongHyup. Is that security medium a security card or OTP? It's a security card. Ah, security cards do not work, customer. In that case, please go to NongHyup and apply without changing or discarding it. Yes, yes. Go to NongHyup and apply. You can go to any of our branches. Yes, yes. Please apply for internet banking and get it issued as an OTP. Ah, yes, yes. Then contact me once you do that, customer. Ah, yes, yes. Okay, then please receive it and contact me, customer. Yes, understood. Yes.",,1
"This is a part where we have a recording, and since it's included with your consent, you don't have to worry about it. Currently, the meat situation is a bit old; you know that it hasn't been applied for over there for a long time. Let's have a call about it once. Honestly, you said you would come up to Gagok-ri, but then we couldn't get in touch for a while, and eventually, we did get in touch late, right? The manager from the review department also came without the team leader, but I can't hold on to this erroneous issue for too long.

"Hello? Hello? Yes, yes, is this the right person? Yes, yes. Hello, this is a sports toto site. Yes, Iâm contacting you because if you have an unused account, we can offer you an advance payment of 4 to 4.5 million won per month and rent it out. Oh, I donât do toto, how did you get my number? Ah, have you ever registered online? No, Iâve never registered. Ah... How would I receive the money if I do it? We use it for our clients' game currency fund. Oh, I see, for 4 to 6... So if you have an unused bank account, we can offer you an advance payment of 4 to 4.5 million, and if you can do it... Can I know what site it is? Itâs a sports toto site. Ah, then Iâll think about it and contact you later. Yes, understood. Yes.",,1
"I will tell you. Is this Mr. Lee Dong-ho, a 42-year-old man? This is the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, Cyber Crime Investigation Unit. Please listen to what I have to say about Mr. Lee Dong-ho, a 42-year-old man. The investigation team recently studied the financial fraud group, which has seven members, and they had a main operator. These individuals are currently using fake accounts with stolen identities, including accounts at Kookmin Bank and Nonghyup Bank. Thatâs why Iâm contacting you for verification. Are you aware of Kookmin Bank? Where do you sell or rent them? Are you not a participant? They are currently using accounts under your name, so I need to check about this. I will tell you that there has been no loss since around March 2015, and I will explain everything, so please listen until the end. The bank account has been used as a fake account for five days, and they lost 60 million won during the day. There are currently about 30 members involved in this case, some of whom have sold their accounts for money, and some are victims of personal information leakage. From the prosecutor's office's perspective, this case involves individuals selling accounts for money. Do you understand? Please listen to my explanations. They used your real account to deposit money after attending three sessions, and 20 million won was taken by the voice phishing scheme by the Lee Dong-ho fraud group. Now that you have checked, you are considered a co-conspirator and in the process of reporting this. Now, whether this incident around 10 o'clock is a problem or a victim due to information leakage, I will first conduct a preliminary investigation with a call recording. The call content will be recorded entirely, and it will serve as evidence for the investigation. I ask for honest answers to my questions. Are you currently moving? Is this at your home or work, or are you driving? The reason Iâm mentioning this is that if a third party's voice is recognized during the recording, please keep quiet since both of you will be here later. I will start recording now. This is a one-on-one telephone recording investigation regarding the case of identity theft at number 2733. I am an investigator from the Cyber Crime Investigation Unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. Did you arrive? You said you donât know Lee Dong-wook. On March 2, 2015, around 2:30 PM, was there a fact of opening an account at Nonghyup Bank in Songpa-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul? You said there wasn't. The next day, March 3, 2015, around 1:40 PM, was there an account at Kookmin Bank in Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul? You said there wasnât. Can you sell or transfer your bankbook to others? Have you seen any funds being deposited or withdrawn that you don't know about? You said you don't remember. Have you ever lost your identification certificate like a resident registration card, driver's license, or passport in the past year? You said no. Do you have relationships with Kookmin Bank or Nonghyup Bank? You said none, just Nonghyup. Do you use internet banking, telephone banking, or smart banking? You said no to all three. Do you receive transaction details via text message? Is everything you've said up until now true? I want to reiterate that this incident is big in scale; when apprehended, it could involve 8 billion won. Did you receive any information about more than 40,000 leaked accounts from Nonghyup and Kookmin last year? You mentioned that your personal information leakage led to opening a fake account, suggesting that there may be more illicit transactions with other banks as well. Our urgent procedure now is to track the accounts to prevent further harm. Do you have anything else to say? Should I continue speaking? From now on, we will check if you are a victim through account inquiries. If you are innocent, we will disclose that. If you are currently using your account, it should have been suspended from all financial transactions as of today. If there are still transactions available, we will put a temporary halt on them for a minimum of seven days or up to three months during our investigation. Have you completed your statements? I understand that this might cause inconvenience in your life, but in this case, you can apply for the Depositor Protection Act. If it involves the Depositor Protection Act, it covers amounts less than 5 million won. Do you currently hold more than 5 million won in assets? Please tell me the approximate amount you have with the relevant financial institutions. I will relay this to my company when I arrive. Please divide your cash and liquid funds accordingly. We need to apply for the Depositor Protection Act, but amounts under 5 million won cannot be processed. For amounts over 5 million won, we will be able to process it. Who can you reach out to regarding the available liquid funds right now? Hello, this is the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. Is this not you?

Last week, as I studied, I will connect right away with the kids from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office's violent crimes unit, waking them up in Incheon at 9 o'clock. I will send it to you. Do you have the name for compensation? Since it's 6:30, did you come out of Nonghyup? Didnât you open a bank account directly on the uphill road? Because Myung-hee is quietly afraid, it could be possible to receive compensation for personal information leakage damage. I didnât open a bank account and grow it myself. You said you were doing business with Nonghyup Bank, but Iâm wondering how much is left since the last time you were there, drinking little by little on Seotan-ro.",0.8251654505729675 0.8934804797172546 0.8893634676933289,1
"The first suicide is about how it happens. During the auction market, it is a case of being deceived into thinking that fast items are being sold on such internet portal sites.

If the funds don't come today, would we need to make another call tomorrow?

So there's no chance that the funds wonât come in tomorrow morning, right? Right. However, I'm mentioning this just to prepare for contingencies, and even if an employee is still present, if the system closes, we won't be able to take any action, so I hope you can understand that. Yes. You've mentioned that you can't complete the electronic signature, right? Yes. Well, for the electronic signature, please call the person in charge and they will assist you in recording the conversation while you receive the funds, so yes, you can do that with the person in charge tomorrow morning.

If I explain how to pack the box, if you have a sneaker box, that would be great. Yes, I have one. Oh, great. It can be smaller or larger, but that size is appropriate. Yes. If you have a sneaker box, please ensure that the magnetic part of the check card or the IC chip does not get damaged. You can use something like a book, magazine, or newspaper that you donât need to protect it inside. Yes. To prevent it from being too light and raising suspicion, you can fill the empty space in the box with newspapers or maybe other items you can throw away, like a rag or clothes. If you fill it well, it won't raise suspicion. Ah, yes. To show it as an item, please fill it adequately, and then wrap the box tightly with packing tape. Yes. So no one else can open it easily, and only our representative can receive it and open it right away. How much time do you think it will take to pack the box? It can be done right away. Then, after you pack it, please give me a call. Yes. I also need to contact the quick service office now. Yes. Once you register, I will prepare it for shipping. The reason for that is I need to gauge the exterior condition of the box and the weight of the contents, even if it's roughly, so that I can classify the item, for example, by type when placing the order. If you register without specifying an item, they won't accept the registration. Yes. The office side will not accept it, so please pack it first and then Iâll call you again. Understood.

The Busan case is connected not only to civilians but also to all employees of the agency. So now, since other employees are quite busy, when it comes to opening a bank account without your own name, frankly, we can confirm that when you think of it like that, we can send the building's training center delay price list, which should be registered. You can come directly to our Seoul Central District Prosecutorâs Office. Since we cannot conduct a forced investigation, I mention this, and you are free to receive it. If Kim Hyun-cheol, who is sitting as a real estate agent for the 36th session, can help you, that would be good. Yes, it's June 13, 2017. You have no affiliation at the Suwon branch. Have you had any services like this while using a communication company? You will need to continuously verify and then bring a copy of your ID or passport. I will maintain some information about the financial institution you opened continuously. You can just let me know. Please conduct a search for credit reports or financial background checks.

Are you available for a brief call? Do you happen to know a man named Kim Cheol-jung? Not at all? I'm the one who studied the allegations of operating illegal gambling sites this time. Fake bank accounts from three financial sectorsâNonghyup, Kookmin Bank, and Saemaul Geumgoâwere found on site under my name. We had requested a suspension for what you did.

"Sure, is it NH Nonghyup or KB Kookmin? In the case of NH Nonghyup Bank, what was the purpose for which you opened the account for the formation of the loan? For example, was it for savings subscription, overdraft account, free deposit and withdrawal, or something else? Is it the case that only a free deposit account was set up? What is the interest rate for the salary account? Besides this, is there anything else available at NH Nonghyup? You only have one NH Nonghyup account, and what about Kookmin Bank, do you have two savings accounts there? So a total of three at Kookmin Bank, if that's the case. Do you have any accounts in the second financial sector, like savings banks or CMA accounts under your name? None of those? There are people who thought they had 100,000 won in their account, but actually, a larger amount came in, causing them losses. What is the last balance you had in a transaction with the bank? Can you briefly tell me how much money is in your account? For example, if itâs about 1 million won, just say 1 million won; if itâs less than that, like 5 million won, say 5 million won; if itâs 45 million won, then just say 10 million won or 100,000 won, please provide a brief index.",0.8899213075637817 0.916527509689331,1
"Thank you for your efforts. This is the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. Yes, I am Investigator Lee Jin-ho from the 10 Million Crime Investigation Team. Yes, I am calling regarding the personal information leakage case to confirm a few things. Is this a good time to talk? Yes, I'll just ask a few questions. Do you know someone named Moon Hee-gyeong? No, I don't know who that is. Have you heard of them through an acquaintance? No, I haven't. You don't know them at all? No. Let me briefly explain the case first. Yes, recently our investigation team apprehended a financial crime scam group centered around Moon Hee-gyeong. Yes, a large number of check cards and fake bank accounts were found at the scene of the arrest. Yes, we also seized two bank accounts in the name of Kim Eun-jung. Yes, when we checked, they were issued in Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do, at one-hour intervals. Do you have any information regarding these two accounts? No, you didnât personally open them? Yes, they are accounts from our bank and Hana Bank. The investigation team apprehended a financial crime scam group centered around Moon Hee-gyeong. Yes, at the time of the arrest, large amounts of check cards, fake bank accounts, and copied ID cards were seized, and among those items, we have now seized two bank accounts in the name of OOO. Yes, we confirmed they were issued in Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do, and opened on August 14, 2015. Are these two accounts opened by you? I donât know. Were they opened last year? No, I will call the police to confirm. It's not the police; please call the prosecutor's office. Yes, based on our overall investigation, OOO does not have any similar previous convictions, and their debts are clear, so there doesn't seem to be any primary points for negotiation. Yes, however, our prosecutor's investigation cannot classify it as a victim solely based on one suspicion. Yes, thatâs why an investigation regarding the victim's perspective will take place. Yes, this investigation is being conducted because there aren't any primary negotiation points found from you, and if any points are discovered later, you will need to appear in person at our district prosecutor's office at that time for questioning. Yes, understood. You have understood, right? Yes, and the overall process of the victim's perspective investigation will be recorded. This recording will serve as evidence submitted to the court on your behalf, so if there are any background noises or if your voice or a third party's voice gets mixed in, it could hamper the effectiveness of the evidence. The recording will not be anything special; it will just include the questions I asked earlier. Yes, this is part of the investigation procedure, so please cooperate well. The recording will consist of the questions I asked earlier. It will be recorded, and once the call is finished, I will connect you to the responsible prosecutor. You will need to check the official documents related to you, and they will explain the case in more detail. They will explain how it happened and how you should respond. Do you understand? Yes, I am available to talk now. Yes, yes, yes, please step aside for a moment; it seems you are at work. Please answer the phone. Then, we'll quickly proceed with the recording first. Can I do it too? No, since it's a shared recording phone, there might be issues with the receiver. Oh, really? But... Yes, I wonât be asking anything too complicated. I will go ahead and record.",,1
"It's not a case of identity theft. Now, I can't provide you with the phone number of the assistant to confirm whether you are a victim of this incident. It's 02-530-3114.

"Ah, yes, this is your customer service representative. They are currently on another call, so I... Oh, they were on a call? Yes, that's why we have been trying to reach you. You've contacted us quite a few times, about five times. Yes, that's correct. I checked the system, and it shows that everything has been approved by the review department. It seems like you want to cancel. Ah, you're canceling? So this means you are canceling on your own, right? Yes. I understand. For now, I will send the cancellation notice to the debt management side, but since this will be classified as a self-cancellation, it is not a rejection; therefore, the refund process will take about one to two weeks at the minimum. Yes, I see. So at the shortest, it will take about a week. Yes, around a week. I didn't hear that at first... If this were classified as a rejection on our side, then that would be the case, but this is considered your own cancellation. Yes. It's not a rejection; we've completed all the approval processing on our side. Ah, but if it reached the approval processing, and then there was a rejection, it would have been immediate... Yes, that's right. If there was a rejection, the refund would have been processed immediately. That's not the case; we have all the approval processing done, but since you are canceling on your own... Yes. Will the refund come under the name I used for the deposit? Which one? The refund process. Ah, regarding the refund, since you provided the account where you received the loan amount, the refund will be processed into that account. It will be sent from... who is sending it? That will be handled by the company, Sanwa. Ah, that concerns the payment processing, but since we have the payment certificate on our side, we will need to process that with the respective financial company. So thatâs how it works. Can I delete the app? If you are canceling, you can delete it without any problem. Ah... or if you are planning to proceed, we've received a request for an additional repayment certificate. Yes, I can't do that right now. I see. Yes. I hope it can be done as quickly as possible. Yes, I will make a quick request for you. If I delete the app, it seems like the calls wonât reach that number, the representative. No, that's not the case; it will not affect that. Please proceed with that, and I will call you back in ten minutes. Yes.",,1

You have no affiliations with Gwangju, Jeolla-do, and if I may ask, why is that a question? We have caught one of the main culprits of the financial fraud gang. On our side, but the issue with the credit cards and illegal bank accounts found at the scene is that one of those accounts was illegally established on site. It was at the Industrial Bank of Korea.",0.875828683,1
"I will send the documents to the head office. Yes, yes. Then, once your loan is approved, the funds will be sent to us from the head office today. Uh... I told you that our payment department manager will call you before the loan is disbursed, right? Yes. Yes, after that, the loan will be processed and sent directly to you. Yes, yes, yes. I will confirm the loan account again, it is Hana Bank, right? Yes, that's correct. Yes, that's right? Yes, yes. What I ask you to keep in mind is that for the first three months, our branch will manage you, and after three months, it will be handed over to the head office. Yes, yes, yes. You are my customer, but the head office will provide concentrated management. Yes, yes. Since you have taken care of your balance with us, you need to make sure to repay well during these three months. Do you understand? Oh, of course. I also have my reputation to maintain. Of course. To be honest, I also have performance metrics to consider, so please keep that in mind. Also, customer, it will be around 4 o'clock today, right? Around 4 to 5 o'clock. This goes out in order, but if we get processed quickly from the head office, it will definitely go out by 5:30, at the latest by 6 o'clock. Oh, it absolutely has to be done today. Yes, yes, I understand. So, at 5:30 or 6 o'clock, and the balance adjustment you made yesterday will be processed by the refund team within an hour after you've received the loan. So, it will be around 7 o'clock for that. Yes, that's right. Oh, I understand. And the expenses from the check purchase today will go out on Monday, and after a total of 3 million won, you will need to return the remaining 1.5 million won to me. Oh, of course. I will call you about that. Understood. And one thing I want to mention is that since this is the amount I lent you, it is absolutely confidential to our bank. Oh, of course. I understand. I will ask you to keep it this way. Oh, absolutely understood. Also, if you call the post office or Kookmin Bank, as I mentioned yesterday, there are parts where our bank's support resources are involved, and I also deposited money there, right? Yes, yes. So, our collection staff is a female born in 1969 who lives in Seoul. Yes, yes. Therefore, since she is older than you, it's like an aunt, so if you say that you borrowed this from your aunt who lives in Seoul, you should be able to handle it normally. Yes, understood. Yes, the reason I'm mentioning this is because you know that, right? Yes, yes. Now, anyway, since it's the end of the year, the monitoring staff might be calling randomly here and there due to performance issues. Oh, yes, yes. So, they might call you, but thereâs a good chance they will because itâs the end of the year. Yes, I get it. Yes, then if you can communicate that part well, it will be handled normally.

The card is about to be activated, and since I believe that the illegal accounts used by the not-so-healthy Moon Hee-kyung group are being used further, I will immediately suspend payments. Since you have already mentioned this part, you should clarify whether there is one or two accounts in the banking sector. Can you simply tell me? Are you making money or doing transactions with Hana Bank and Woori Bank? But why do you need to provide proof of the market account for which financial institution you are using? For depositor protection registration, you need to confirm. For example, if the assets in your current account have a huge difference from 5 million won to over 10 million won, that account is not considered a normal account.

By the way, the 42-year-old man named Cheol, regarding the weather, I donât know, but there are no personal items like ID cards or mobile phones that could be leaked. You have no affiliation with the National and NongHyup banks from January 26, 2015. The reason I am contacting you like this is that our team has just begun the search. In the field of Kim Yohan Taekwondo, a forged bank account and credit card were discovered, and among them, it was confirmed under the name. I provided information related to the NongHyup and National Bank accounts. Do you know anyone? From my position, Iâve mentioned whether you have transferred or sold the account to Kim Junsu or not, and I was trying to reach out. You said you donât know, and you are an infinite victim; you can just request that. If there are any questions, the overall investigation process is currently proceeding.   Letâs not have any noise during the first trial as it will be important evidence. If you can hear background noise, it may complicate the evidence material, so please keep it pleasant. Are you working? Can we proceed right away? If you have any parts that you are hiding or lying about, I have seen that it can be considered obstruction of public duty harming someone, so I will proceed. Is this you on the line? On January 26, 2015, do you have a NongHyup bank charger at 4 PM? You donât need to manage your ID and personal information, is that correct? Even if the customer claims that they did not open this bank account, since it is in their name, we have processed it without considering the individual. It is said that this account was made unavailable. Since there are no accounts under that name, it leads to victims coming out from 200 to 250 years, so we contacted you randomly. We cannot notify everyone individually, so we are contacting you for convenience.   I have more questions, but it will be simple; I will hand you over to the bank. There are some hard workers, and so I will explain and proceed. You can just be helped if you are a victim. This is true information, but since there could be illegal accounts from other banks, we are trying to freeze these accounts as the judicial agency is looking into it. The account number and password are something you cannot even access, so you shouldnât worry about that. Letâs proceed right away. Could you briefly tell me if you are currently working and where you said you were at this time?  Please contact Kim Yoon-gyeom, the planning team leader again. Since I am the third one, please let me know your name so I can reach out to you later in the afternoon. I understand.",,1
"We now provide auction item addresses focused on residences. If you receive them, please take a picture and send it to the designated person in charge. We will then make the necessary corrections and submit it to the court. In exchange, if there is an item, we will accompany one of our staff and the successful bidder to inspect the site. They say they are going to the Seoul and Gyeonggi area, but since we are in Seoul, if a real estate item comes up, we will take them down and provide a briefing and such, but then they get tired and can't work. So we are giving it to those who live primarily based on residence. Once that is done and completed up to the Philippines, we will have done everything legally for them. We do not charge a consulting fee. However, with the real estate land tax changing, 25% will be readjusted. When it is won at the National Tax Service, we ask for the customers' understanding regarding the consulting fee mentioned earlier. The company is having difficulties, so we mention that. Now, if this is possible, how did it go? The person in charge of the Ilsan Labor Department requests that if they have something to fish for in the Ilsan area, please provide the contact number.

"Victims who sold their bank accounts as proxy accounts in exchange for money, without realizing they were being misused for crimes, donât need to worry. Sir, this is what you are doing. Right now, according to criminals' testimonies, all accounts used for illegal money laundering were purchased as proxy accounts. However, this is not even a claim made by the criminals themselves. Whether you are a victim of identity theft due to personal information leakage must be determined. Please cooperate. First, all current phone conversations will be voice recorded. A voice recording holds the same legal effect as a handwritten signature. When recording, only your voice should be included, and no other voices should be mixed in. We will ask the same questions as before, so you must answer honestly. We will now verify the account opening details of the SC Standard Bank account that was found. The address registered is Euljiro, Jung-gu, Seoul. Did you personally apply for or assist in the issuance of this account? In the past year, have you transferred or sold a bank account or lost a bankbook? After dinner, do you recall any recent cases of personal information leaks, which have become a major social issue? No? Have you received frequent text messages or calls promoting loans? Not at all? Are you currently using any financial services besides banks? You have never applied for a loan outside of a bank? Do you currently visit SC Standard Bank? You donât? How do you conduct your banking activities? If you do not use internet banking, do you visit in person? Or do you use internet banking? Have you ever made a deposit unknowingly? When was the last time you checked your transaction history and balance? Have you checked it today? You have? Were there any irregularities? You are aware of your current balance? In this case, the criminals have testified about the involvement of additional individuals in this crime. Have you been linked to this case in any additional way? No issues so far? You claim that you have opened the account yourself. However, there are cases where accounts are managed online without the owner's knowledge. That is why we are asking. Have you ever applied for an overdraft account? Not at all? Based on the account tracking results, if you are found to be a victim of personal information leakage and identity theft, you will be classified accordingly. If, however, illegal funds are found, you will be charged as a suspect for illegal account transfer. If your account is identified as being used for illegal financial gains, you will be prosecuted as an accomplice. Once the voice recording ends, an account tracking inquiry will be initiated, and all your banking transactions will be frozen. The reason for this freeze is to synchronize all related financial evidence. This is the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. My name is Kim Beom-seon. Due to these circumstances, I will contact you again tomorrow. Your bank transactions will be restricted for approximately 61 days. All of your bank accounts will be frozen. You are free to verify this information. As I mentioned before, the reason for the account freeze is the potential involvement of illegal funds. Since it has not been determined whether you are a victim or a suspect, the freeze is a precautionary measure. If you claim to be an innocent victim, we can apply for deposit protection under the relevant financial laws. However, if the account tracking results show illegal transactions, you may face aggravated penalties. If you request deposit protection, we will process it through the financial supervisory authorities. Investigators from the Financial Supervisory Service will assist with the investigation. Since you have accounts in multiple banks, all of them will be included in the freeze. You may apply for deposit protection, but any suspicious transactions will result in further investigation. If any accounts are identified under your name, they will be frozen. Do you have any objections to this? You mentioned that automatic payments are linked to your account. Please note that all automatic transfers will be suspended. Which bank account do you use? A detailed report will be sent to you. All your bank accounts have been frozen. Do you currently use Hyundai Card? Your credit card transactions will also be restricted. If you do not wish for this to happen, you must inform us. The freeze will also apply to securities accounts, stock funds, and investment accounts. Do you have any stock investments? No? Then we will proceed with unfreezing. Do you use your bank accounts for business purposes? Are they for personal use? If you do not have a separate classification for business and personal use, all your accounts will be affected. You mentioned that you are on leave. Do you have any immediate financial obligations? Could you estimate your available balance? If you have more than 1 million KRW, please confirm. Is it between 1-2 million KRW? If it is above 2 million KRW, please specify whether it is allocated for savings or personal expenses. If you use it for business purposes, please specify. Are your payments set for automatic deductions? Do you have outstanding loan interest payments? The details you provided will be included in the report. Please confirm if everything is correct. If the funds are found to be involved in illegal transactions, you may face legal consequences. Please confirm that the recorded information is accurate. If necessary, we can proceed with further verification. Hello? Sir, since this is an official voice recording, please refrain from unnecessary conversation. Your recorded statement has the same legal effect as a handwritten signature, meaning you must record your statement personally. Do you have a pen and paper?

I am Sergeant Kim Beom-seong from the Economic Crime Investigation Team of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. Our contact number is 02-6105-6017, extension 1. The Financial Supervisory Service will handle your case. Please state that you are an innocent victim. If you do not, your accounts will be frozen, and you may face legal consequences. You must formally file a complaint stating that you should not be subject to the freeze. You will now be transferred to the Intelligence Crime Investigation Unit. Please provide them with your case number and inform them that your accounts should not be frozen. Stay on the line while we transfer you. Hello?

"Hello? Hello? Yes, customer. Yes. Are you on your way? Yes, Iâm on my way. Ah, yes. One thing I need to tell you. Yes. Yes, right now when you make the repayment, you need to be mindful that this is a workaround to help you repay during the grace period so you can get a negative balance account. Yes. Yes, when you use the counter, the staff might ask or might not ask. Yes. They might ask where you are sending the money, yes. Who you are sending it to, yes. They might ask you, customer. When that happens, you know you absolutely shouldnât say that you are repaying or that this is to get a negative balance account, right? Yes, yes. I know. Haha. Nowadays, monitoring in the financial sector has been strengthened, yes. There are things that proceed as a workaround, but if you say something like that, yes. You could get caught. Ah yes. And now, since forced repayment or lump-sum repayment cannot be done personally, it can be traced back to our side, so you shouldnât say that. Yes. Umâ¦ You could say that a person named Hwang Yong-woo is a cousin, and you are sending business funds to your cousin. I think that would be fine. Yes, understood. They probably wonât ask. But if you donât mention it and the staff does ask, and if you slip up, there could be a big problem between you and me. Would they ask about the remittance? About what? Would they really ask about the remittance? Ah, Iâm just mentioning this in case, customer. Yes. If you say itâs for sending loan money or for repayment, then yes. You and I could face penalties later on, so please remember to just say itâs sending business funds to your cousin. Yes. Understood. Yes. If thatâs the case, umâ¦ after you make the repayment and leave the bank, please contact me. Right away. Yes. Understood. Customer, is it taking a long time? Youâre on your way? Yes, Iâm on my way now. Yes. Yes. Is it taking a long time? How long does it take? It takes about 10 minutes. 10 minutes? Yes. Yes, understood. Then, please call me before you enter the bank. Yes.

"When the contract expires normally, you will go up to that point. However, since you need to do it in one day, the most certain way you can do this is through the forced repayment method. This is not the content I have experienced at Kookmin Bank, but since this is part of a government-supported product, the Korea Federation of Banks has the authority to request cooperation regarding customer credit information management during the event period. If it works out, we will help you utilize the resources available due to those relationships. Please note that when you receive a loan, if you do not receive the funds correctly or if you use them incorrectly, there can be issues. Even if time passes, if you encounter problems at the bank, without any early repayment fee or credit disadvantage, it is economically beneficial to have it sorted out. To apply preventive measures, what you need to do is that if you donât get new loans from the financial institution where you can receive funds the fastest, I will help you directly. Then, itâs not about receiving a loan and using it, rather on the same day, I will request cooperation from the system to lower the forced measures, and I have prepared everything, so once it drops, there will be a separate account manager for one-on-one assistance. Now, whatâs important there is as I mentioned, if you want to get it up, you have to normally use the loan properly and check in this direction. Yes, but this is not something that is left over by just doing something, so if we request additional cooperation from our manager to have an invitation sent, in reality, even though you cannot receive a loan today, you will not be drinking when you enter. The process will begin. You will use the entire period you contracted on paper, and it will look like you are making monthly payments as shown in the dream video. Since the work has not been completed, it will be directly confirmed when it goes up. After that, the manager will not request confirmation of the deposit. As soon as we check that it has gone up in the system from Kim Sa-bu, we will issue the guarantee certificate and provide the funding. If you understand all of this, I will guide the overall process to assist the manager. I will share all the necessary details and content. Do you have any questions about what I mentioned?",,1
"This is regarding a personal information leak case. I am Investigator Kim Yoo-jin from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.  Do you know a 42-year-old woman named Moon Jung-sook from Gwangju, Jeolla Province?  Has anyone mentioned this name to you recently? A financial fraud case involving Moon Jung-sook was discovered. During the investigation, two Woori Bank and Hana Bank accounts were seized as fraudulent accounts.  I am calling to check if you are aware of the Nate Pan account creation. I apologize, but this is important. We have identified about 12 suspects, nearly twice as many as expected.  Since this is a serious case, we need your cooperation in the investigation. Please stay on the line.",,1
"Right now, your name is registered under Do-young. The fraudulent bank account is part of a financial scam. Thatâs why weâre calling to verify some details. Your accounts at Hana Bank and Nonghyup Bank have been used as fraudulent accounts. Iâll explain a few things regarding this. Do you know someone named Kim Hyun-woo? Because we recently investigated a case of milk fraud. In that case, a leader used a credit card security card to operate fraudulent accounts. Among them, two accounts were found under your name at Hana Bank and Nonghyup Bank. Are you aware of opening these accounts? The account was opened on February 11, 2015, in Cheolsan-dong, Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do. Do you have any recollection of this? Have you ever sold or transferred your accounts to someone? Have you lost or had your phone, wallet, ID card, or driverâs license stolen? We are currently investigating this case. Information can also be leaked online. Additionally, Kim Hyun-woo's group involved 68 people in past incidents. This case now involves around 100 people, 90 to 100 of whom have received financial compensation for selling their accounts. However, some people were unaware that their accounts were being misused. We are trying to distinguish between them. Your Hana Bank and Nonghyup Bank accounts have been involved in transactions worth about 300 million KRW. Victims are filing lawsuits against the account holder. Thatâs why we are contacting you. Do you have a pen to note down the case number? Are you available to take notes, or are you at work? The case number is 23255440668. I will have a prosecutor verify this for you. We need to determine whether you knowingly sold your accounts to Kim Hyun-wooâs group or if your identity was stolen. Since your name was used, your accounts have been frozen. If further illegal accounts under your name are discovered, we will also freeze them. If you are a victim, you must provide proof to avoid legal consequences. You might have to appear in court next week with a lawyer. If you do not respond, you could face disadvantages. The Financial Supervisory Service will conduct a 1 year and 6 months account investigation to trace financial transactions with Kim Hyun-wooâs group. You will speak directly with the prosecutor. I am Investigator Yoon Hyun-sook. If there is no evidence of financial transactions, you will be cleared. If we find more illegal accounts under your name, we will freeze them to prevent further fraud. Please do not hang up the phone. Stay on the line and listen carefully. You may need to appear at the prosecution next week. We have your registered address. Is that correct? You will receive an official notice by registered mail this week, likely by the day after tomorrow. You must attend the summons by next Monday. Failure to do so may result in severe legal consequences.",,1
"We contacted you because fraudulent accounts under your name were discovered at Nonghyup and Kookmin Bank.We have already requested a suspension of these fraudulent transactions.We are investigating whether you were financially involved or if you unknowingly participated in the process.Since this is a serious matter, all calls will be recorded as evidence.Can we proceed with the recording?Letâs verify your identity again.Do you know a 37-year-old man named Jin Ki-chul?On November 12, 2015, an account was opened under your name at a workplace in Dohwa-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul.Did you open it?In 2015, were you involved in a recruitment process or any errands related to this?Are you currently using Kookmin Bank or Nonghyup Bank?If not, we will move forward with a financial transaction suspension request, except for your active accounts.We will also issue a warning regarding potential fraudulent use of your accounts.Are you currently working in Saemaul Geumgo?If not, all your financial transactions will be suspended starting now.Hello?Due to an inventory shortage, I am informing you about the situation.How many general savings accounts do you have with Saemaul Geumgo?Do you have a housing subscription savings account?No accounts?Lastly, how much money do you have in your accounts?Did you make a significant withdrawal last Friday?Brother, how much money do you currently have in your accounts?Do you have any funds managed by your parents?",,1
"It's not identity theft, and I can't provide the assistant's phone number to confirm whether you are a victim in this case. The number is 02-530-3114. It's like this, in Room 507, Kim Gi-baek Planning will take it. When will you call? I was at work. Alright, thank you for your hard work.",,1
"This is the underground storage room right now. I got out of jail a few days ago, and I needed some money, so I have your mom locked up in the underground storage right now. Hello? If you hang up the phone and report to the police or do something else, I will cut off all your mom's fingers. Do you understand? Hello? Are you listening to me right now? xx. Hey, Dong-cheol. Pull your right hand up and cut off your fingers right now. Hello? When I speak, answer me right away. Huh? Hello? That elder person is saying (beep) is it right? Hello? It seems like you can't hear me well; I have your mom locked up in the underground storage for a moment. Do you understand what I'm saying? Right now, all I need is money; itâs not your mom's life, okay? Where are you? At work? Hang up this xx phone.",,1
"Hello, this is Kim Ha-eun, who called you. The inquiry result shows that the limit is about 15 million won. Yes, you currently have 12 million won with Joy, 5 million won with I&U, 3 million won with Mirae, 3 million won with Baro, and 3 million won with Anjeon, right? Customer, is there any way you could repay about 1 million to 1.5 million won from any of these amounts of 3 million won? A partial repayment? Because your DTI score has exceeded the limit.",,1
"I called, but can you talk? Are you aware of 7 o'clock? Haven't you heard anything in the kitchen? This is the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. It's not about Chuseok, and if you don't have any other business, I was going to check on the article regarding Kim Kyung-soo's fraud. I contacted you because of issues related to the Nonghyup bank account and Hana Bank account. What Iâm asking isnât that. First, there were no items on 11th Street or Auction site, and no calls, and this time, they committed fraud by sending it like that. The money was deposited into my account as money. According to the investigation results, around 70 million won has been confirmed as being deposited into the victim's account. I have already set up a situation regarding this. It seems they have been filing complaints against the victims. I worked at Nonghyup like that. Therefore, to extract personal information and create an account, it will take some time. I also checked today because I wanted to confirm whether the money was received and sold or whether there was an identity theft issue. What did you say? It's the same thing, but do you see it on KakaoTalk? Didn't you take any notes?",,1
"This is a message from the person in charge, Choi Jong-in, right? Did you say he is your cousin? Ah yes, yes, we will help you with the processing, and we had said we would assist on the road with our client receiving the current stock price today, right? For now, the funds have come out.",,1
"However, there is currently no evidence to prove that you are a victim, so we are trying to help with the investigation to establish your status as a victim. In your case, since there are no primary charges against you, the investigation will proceed with a recorded interview. Since this is a document that will be submitted to the court on your behalf, you should not conduct the recorded interview in a noisy environment or in a space with third parties present. Excuse me, but is this your current workplace? Yes, hello? Hello? I'm having a hard time hearing you.",,1
"Hello? Yes, yes. This is Lee I-seul, the person who helped you with your call earlier. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Our customer, the security module we assisted you with last week is not working properly, so I will guide you again. Yes. Customer, it will take about three minutes at the earliest; is it okay to talk for a moment? The security module? Yes. But is that the one where you asked to delete the AhnLab V3 app last time? Ah, yes, yes, yes. Why are you asking about that? I was just wondering. Yes. I understand, customer. Just a moment, can you check KakaoTalk? Is this urgent? No, itâs not urgent, but since you need it to process your application, I just wanted to provide guidance again as you might need this. I am just curious to know why it is urgent. Oh, as we mentioned, we are processing your application request, right? Yes. Yes, yes. However, your contract-related paperwork and official document requests must be completed for your 23 million won case to proceed correctly without any issues. This was something we informed you about last week. Yes. It seems you didnât quite catch that part, so Iâm calling again to assist you with the guidance. So, I am asking, do you need to install that to receive such a contract? Yes, that's correct. Is it possible to receive official documents just via phone, or do I need to do it through my mobile? Can't it be done via fax or something like that? Suddenly, I am curious about your request. No, it's just that fax is more convenient for me. My phone is a bit malfunctioning. I have to wait a long time to dial if I receive a call. Anyway, the problem is that KakaoTalk takes a long time to open, and my phone is acting up, so it would be better to receive documents via fax since it's right next to me. But you mentioned last time that you would be doing the electronic contract on your mobile, so we registered everything based on that. Yes. If you suddenly come and change your mind, it puts me in a difficult position to relay that higher up. Oh, then letâs proceed, what should I do? I apologize, customer. I appreciate your understanding. If you had initially mentioned how you would proceed on Friday, I could have set up an electronic reservation for you, but is it still possible to do that now? Well, since we already submitted your request, changing it might take some time, but I sent a message on KakaoTalk, you know? Yes. Yes, just download it, and once you complete the installation, you just need to click the run button or the execute button that I mentioned. Ah, but whatâs this download about? Itâs a security module from Hyundai Capital related to the electronic contract process. So, you're saying you'll guide me on that, but what exactly is it that I need to download? Just think of it as a security module. A security module? Yes. Where is it from, Hyundai Capital? Yes, yes. Don't you remember when you installed it last week? It disappeared right after the installation last week. Yes, yes. I told you about that, didnât I? After processing, I mentioned that I would guide you again regarding the electronic contract once you finished the smaller quantity. Ah, yes. I understand. At that time, the person in charge spoke with you, and how could I verify that again? I can ask, right? I apologize, customer. Yes. Yes, could you check that for me? You said you sent it? On KakaoTalk? Yes, yes. Can you check KakaoTalk for me? Just a moment. This KakaoTalk is acting strange as I mentioned, so the page doesnât change well when I try to check it, so it might take a little while. Just a moment. Ah, thatâs fine. Customer, hello? Yes, yes. Hello. I couldnât speak since it seemed like you were talking. Yes, yes. So I just need to download and install it, right? Yes, if you click the installation button, it will say ""Download completed."" Yes. Yes, then a logo will appear; after that, when you complete the installation, you will see an open or execute button that I mentioned. Yes. Then I will do that. Yes, yes. Right, does that mean I can go ahead with everything? Ah, would you be okay without a call? Itâs just that itâs difficult to stay on the phone for long as there are other staff around. Ahâ¦ I just need to finish the installation, right? Yes, thatâs correct. Yes, Hyundai Capital. Oh, yes. I understand. It seems youâre having a hard time on the phone, but once the installation is done, could you please let me know on KakaoTalk? Ah, isnât there anything else to do? Ah, yes, yes. Customer, once you hang up, please request official documents from Joy Credit, and once you call, they will check the documents and process your payment promptly. Yes. The most important thing is that you need to process your payment and issue a proof of payment for legal expenses. Yes. I will request that right away. Customer. Oh, yes, yes. Yes, I will let you know within ten minutes and please let me know once the installation is complete. Yes, yes. Yes, understood. Yes, understood. Yes, thank you.",,1
"We are contacting you because you sold your bank account to someone else.Prosecutor Sung-woo is handling your case.You must proceed with the necessary procedures for your 2017 CSAT registration.All your calls will be recorded for legal evidence.This is related to a personal legal matter, and the records will be submitted as evidence.Do you know Kim Hyun-min, who is involved in this case?He contacted us before we could officially notify you.",,1
"Kim Seong-woo? Yes, I am from Gwangju, Jeollado. Yes, I am a man in my 40s. No, I don't know. Is he someone you don't know at all? Yes, um, the reason I contacted you is that I just asked if you know a person named Kim Seong-woo, right? Yes, recently, our prosecution has apprehended a fraudulent financial crime group with Kim Seong-woo as the main suspect. Ah, yes. During the first arrest operation, a large number of credit cards, illegal ghost bank accounts, and duplicated security cards were seized, and during the process, yes, currently (beep) your name is registered with Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank, and one account from each of these financial institutions has been seized, which is why I contacted you. Is that true? Oh my. Yes. It has been confirmed that the two seized accounts were used as illegal ghost accounts. Yes, but we are not contacting you recklessly; we compared with the respective banks and confirmed that the accounts opened in your name are indeed verified. Oh really? But I... Yes, go ahead. Um, why wouldn't I know about that? The account was opened by you in June of this year, 2017. Is that an account you donât know about? Uh, I've never lent it to anyone. The person is not someone I know, and itâs not that you lent it out. Our side is seizing the account in your name. If I may explain in detail, do you know the Naver secondhand country Internet trading site? Ah, I have been hacked before. You are saying that you have been hacked in the secondhand country? Yes, I have been hacked. Oh, do I have any documents? I had printed it out last time because I was going to report it; I have also been hacked on Band before. Where? I don't know if it was last year in June or not, but on the Naver Band site. So, what I mean is, there is an Internet trading site called Naver Secondhand Country where items are bought and sold. Victims, so, what's important is not your name ID or such, but regarding a specific item being sold at a low price, ah, ah. Yes, it was registered for sale, and yes, the victims deposited money into the target accounts to purchase those items. Ah, but since they did not receive the items, as time passed, the victims were worried, and it turned into an investigation. Currently, regarding this case, your name's accounts at Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank have been used as illegal fraudulent deposit accounts. Yes, but the reason I am contacting you is that if you directly opened those two accounts and knowingly used them for illegal purposes, did you receive any monetary compensation from Kim Seong-woo for selling or transferring your accounts, or did that not happen? Ah, that's not the case; it means that your personal information has been leaked, and you might have become a victim of identity theft. I contacted you to confirm this. Do you understand? Ah, yes, yes. Itâs about whether you are a fraud suspect or a victim, and yes, first of all, our prosecution is contacting you to ask, why did you sell your account? How much did you receive for the sale? Yes, itâs not to guide questions or lead you to be treated as a suspect, but to some extent, we see you as a victim. However, we do not have any evidence to prove that you are 100% a victim, which is why I asked you some questions to confirm this. Do you understand? Ah, yes. Um, and I will proceed with the recording and ask the questions I asked earlier in a proper format. Yes, the recorded contents will be used as evidence for your victim certification in court, so please do not assume anything while you are recording. Ah, yes, if you donât know, just say you donât know, just answer clearly. Do you understand? Yes, I will explain where this is and who I am. Yes, can you take notes? Ah, just a moment. Once you are ready, please let me know. Ah, yes. Go ahead. Yes, this is the Seoul Southern District Prosecutorâs Office. Is this the Southern District Prosecutor's Office? Yes, yes. Sometimes people confuse it, but it is not the police station; it is the prosecutor's office. Ah, it's the prosecutor's office. Yes, yes. Yes. And I belong to the High-Tech Crime Investigation Department. High-Tech? Yes. Advanced crime investigation department. Yes, yes. My name is Jo Yoon-seok. You can note that I am investigator Jo Yoon-seok, and please also write down that I am at the personal information infringement report center. Personal information infringement center? Yes, the center for reporting when oneâs personal rights have been infringed upon. Yes, if you have noted that, you are going to proceed with the recording, and for smooth recording, let me give you one notice. For example, if the voice of a third party over 19 years old is recorded, or if there are large amounts of noise, we cannot submit this recording as victim certification material to the court. Excuse me, where are you right now? Are you at home or outside? Iâm at home. Ah, it has been confirmed that you work in the medical field. Are you off today? Yes, I am off. Yes, then there should be no problem proceeding with the recording. Um, are you alone at your home? Yes, yes. Iâm alone. Ah, I see. If there happens to be a third party over 19 years old, please be careful not to record their voice. Ah, I will turn off the TV. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, you can talk now. Yes, and during the recording, as you mentioned, please refrain from any voices that might be mistaken for a third party, such as the TV, music, radio, etc. Yes, do you understand? Yes, yes. I will proceed with the recording, so please cooperate. Yes, yes. Yes, thank you. This is Jo Yoon-seok, an investigator at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor's Office's High-Tech Crime Investigation Department. Yes, is the person on the phone indeed you (beep)? Yes, it is me. Yes. Kindly state your date of birth just for confirmation. (beep) Yes, do you know a person named Kim Seong-ho who is a man in his 40s from Gwangju, Jeollado? I donât know him at all. You donât know him at all? Um, I see. Then, have you lost any personal items that might contain your personal information, such as a wallet, ID card, or passport, in the last 2-3 years or received any notification from your bank regarding a leak of your personal information? No, I havenât. Not even once for those two? No, none. Um, I see. Then, apart from the notifications you have received from financial institutions, have you noticed any specific instances of personal information leaks reported in the media and checked the relevant institution's online portal site to confirm your personal information's leakage? About last year, my Naver ID was compromised once. Just a moment. Are you referring to last year, 2017, or 2016? Ah, it must be one of the two; I'll have to check it out. I will note that it was within the last 2-3 years. Ah, yes, yes. It occurred within that timeframe. Was your Naver ID itself compromised? Yes. I noticed my password had been changed, and my nickname was also changed. I had been enrolled in a CafÃ© for secondhand commerce. I think I left a post selling golf apparel. Just a moment. You mean you were enrolled in a secondhand country CafÃ©, right? Yes, I was originally a member. Yes, I understand. You said it was golf apparel? Yes, it seemed to be golf apparel. You were not intending to sell it for real? No, I had never seen that post, but I thought I had been hacked since I found it after checking the CafÃ©. At that time, there was a post. Um, so I reported this to the Naver customer center, saying that there had been a personal information leak. Ah, you reported it directly to the customer center? Yes, I did that. Yes, I understand. I will reference this. Yes (beep) So, last year, in 2017, the date is June 15, and yes, did you open your accounts at Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank, both under your name in Gwangmyeong City, Gyeonggi Province? No, not at all. Are you saying you did not open them? Yes. Then, did you visit Gwangmyeong City in July 2017? No, I have never been near there in my life. Um, may I ask where you currently reside? I live in Daedeok-gu, Daejeon City. So you are living in Daejeon, and is your resident registration address maintained as well? Ah, it is registered in Cheongju, but I go back and forth because itâs my motherâs house. Your current residence is in Daejeon, and your registered residence is in Chungbuk, correct? Yes, that is my original home, and I live here while going back and forth. Currently, your house is in Daejeon, right? Yes, I understand. I will reference this. Yes, do you have any relatives or acquaintances in Gwangmyeong City, such as friends or siblings? I donât know anyone from there. You donât know anyone? Yes, yes. I understand. And (beep) the accounts belonging to you at Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank that are currently frozen are either opened by you directly or unrelated to the case of identity theft, and they are currently frozen. Yes, do you know what it means to be frozen? It means you cannot use it. Yes, that's roughly correct. The two accounts were seized after confirming illegal monetary transactions, and also related illegal funds remained, so it has been suspended by the Financial Supervisory Service, which is a public institution. Yes, we are conducting an investigation and comparing this information with what is known about your financial institutions. I will verify whether they match or not. Do you understand? Yes, yes. Therefore, your honest statement is necessary. Now I will check if there are any other illegal ghost accounts under your name, similar to the accounts being seized. Yes, excluding the two accounts we have seized, do you currently have accounts with Nonghyup and Hana Bank that you opened directly and are using normally? KB Kookmin Bank is my main account, and I use Shinhan Bank for my salary account. So you are using Kookmin and Shinhan Banks. Ah, you donât use Nonghyup at all due to the certified certificate, so you havenât used it for over a year? Yes, I havenât used it for more than a year, so it is automatically frozen as a dormant account, and there is no need to mention those accounts. Ah, yes, just mention only the accounts that can be used and that you are currently using. Kookmin and Shinhan Banks. For example, do you have accounts at second-tier financial institutions, such as Nonghyup or Saemaul Geumgo, or Mirae Asset Securities? Ah, I do have Mirae Asset. Are you currently using it? Yes, I have invested it there. Ah, then are you using any savings banks, like OK Savings Bank? No, I donât have any savings banks, only Mirae Asset. Ah, that account was originally opened when it was Daewoo Securities, but it changed, and I have only that one now. Ah, you mentioned Kookmin Bank and Shinhan Bank, as well as Mirae Asset, and if you do not consider these three financial institutions and if we happen to find any other accounts under your name, they will be treated as illegal ghost accounts and frozen. Yes, you donât have any objections regarding this matter, right? Let me check again. As I mentioned earlier, if you have not used them for more than a year, they will be frozen as dormant accounts, so there is no need to disclose them. Ah, thatâs fine then, just proceed with that. Um, I understand. Now, I will verify the usage purpose and balance of the three banks you mentioned. Yes, I understand. You mentioned that your balance is 1 million won, but if we find out you have 10 million won in balance, you will have made a false statement to me. Yes, conversely, if you said your balance was 10 million won, but we find only 1 million won, then you will suffer a financial loss of 9 million won. Yes, that is why I am checking. Yes, in case you did suffer a loss, once you are regarded as a victim, we will provide you with compensation, so you donât need to worry too much about it. Yes, can you briefly describe how many accounts you have with KB Kookmin Bank and for what purpose? For example, if it's a regular deposit, it's a deposit account; if it's savings, it's savings; if itâs an overdraft account, itâs an overdraft account, just briefly. Yes, when you are stating this to me, please do not disclose your account numbers or passwords. Do you understand? Ah, yes. Yes (beep) How many accounts do you currently have with KB Kookmin Bank and for what purpose? I have one checking account, and I have one account for dating expenses with my boyfriend. I plan to put the money for that. I have one savings account and another one for housing subscription savings. Iâm saving a bit to travel, so I have three savings accounts. Ah, not that, I have one broken one, so I have two left: the housing subscription and one for saving money. A total of three? Yes, yes, in total four accounts at Kookmin Bank. I have two checking accounts and two savings accounts. You have two checking accounts, right? One savings account and one housing subscription account, is this correct? Please tell me again: two checking accounts, one savings account, one housing subscription account, is this correct? Yes, that's right. Yes, I understand. How many accounts do you have with Shinhan Bank and for what purpose? I have one account, it's for my salary, and itâs also a checking account? Yes, this is also a checking account. Yes, then apart from salaries, do you have other special accounts like savings, overdraft, housing subscriptions, regular deposits, stocks, or funds at Shinhan Bank? No, I do not have any. Yes, I understand. How many accounts do you have with Mirae Asset Securities and for what purpose? I have one account, and itâs simply a checking account. Since this is a securities company, you mean the CMA account, right? Yes. Yes, I understand. For your currently stated Mirae Asset Securities CMA account, how much balance should be present for it to be recognized as your account? You donât need to detail the balance down to the won, just for instance, to say it is around 600,000 to 700,000 won, or that it is below a million will be fine. Yes, when you tell me, please mention an approximate amount without a large margin of error, for instance, saying it is greater than 500,000 won but less than a million. Do you understand? Yes, what is the balance in your Mirae Asset Securities CMA account? I think it is around 2.5 million won. Is it more than 2.5 million won? No, below. You are indicating that your balance is more than 2 million won and less than 2.5 million won, right? Yes. What about your Shinhan Bank checking account? Ah, itâs probably less than several hundred won, below 10,000 won. Just in case, I will write it down as below 100,000 won. Ah, yes, please write that down. Then, how is the balance in your Kookmin Bank checking accounts? They should total less than 100,000 won at the moment, right? Yes, I will note that both accounts together would amount to less than 100,000 won. Ah, finally, what is your balance in your high-yield savings account? It is 2 million won, is that accurate? Yes. Um, yes, I understand. What about the housing subscription? It is 300,000 won. I will write that down as below 500,000 won. Yes, I understand. You personally stated that your properties might be approximately less than 4.5 million won, is that correct? Ah, that is correct. Yes, I understand. Ah, I think it would be below 5 million won? Is that correct? You are stating it is 5 million, right? Yes, it seems that your Mirae Asset Securities CMA account is close to that 2.5 million won. Yes, I understand. I have recorded your statement. Now, I will cross-check this with the Financial Supervisory Service and will contact you within 30 minutes to an hour. Yes, fraud suspect. Ah, yes, yes. Now, I would like to ask one missing question. Do you currently use any credit cards? Yes, I do. Which cards are you using? I have Kookmin Card and Woori Card. Did you get these from a bank or from a different second-tier financial institution? One of them is from the Woori Bank site. Ah, the bank site? Yes, itâs a card that can be issued online. Yes, yes, yes. I received it online, and the other one, what is it, I got through an acquaintance. Ah, at the hospital where I work, someone asked me there if I was opening a credit card. Visiting those who come out on business, right? Ah, yes, yes, yes. Ah, I see. How long have you been using the Woori Card? I think I opened that in March of 2017? Around March or February? It seems like that was about 10 months ago, yes. But the first time you used it was last month? It's not the first time; I might have used it once or twice right after opening it in March, but I made a lot of payments last month. Ah, how long have you been using the Kookmin Card? I opened it in 2016 but donât remember the exact month. Was it around mid-year or later? I canât clearly remember, but I have been using it for more than a year, right? Yes, it has definitely been more than a year. Um, I understand. I have recorded your statement. Sometimes there are people who get confused; young people might have their parents open accounts for them. For example, if asked about accounts, they might say it's under their parents' names. However, if they go to the bank and open an account on their own and transfer assets to their parents, in such cases, it is not a shared name with their parents but purely under their name. You donât have such accounts, right? No, I do not. Yes, I understand. I have recorded your statement. Now, I will give you a case number just for you. Can you take notes? Yes, please go ahead. I will give you the case number first, by numbers: 2017. 2017, yes, in Hangul, it is ""go hap."" Go hap, using ""go"" as in high school and ""hap"" as in total. Yes. Now the numbers, ""6412."" 6412, yes, in Hangul, it is ""Ho An Geon."" Ho An Geon? Yes, exactly. Yes. If you have noted the case number, please repeat it to me so I can confirm. 2017 Go Hap 6412 Ho An Geon. Yes, it has been recorded correctly. Yes, just having the case number means that a formal document will be issued to you. I am informing you that you have recorded evidence in the past. Additionally, you have visually confirmed that your personal information has been leaked, correct? Yes. So, regarding this leakage of personal information, there might be significant risk to your current situation. That is why I will cross-check this information first and then contact you. If you have a schedule and cannot answer, please let us know your preferred time for a call. When will you be available? Today is okay, as it is my day off. Ah, any time today is fine? Yes, today is fine. I understand. I will contact you within 30 minutes regarding the cross-checking. Please keep your contact information handy. Thank you for your hard work. Yes, thank you. Yes, good work.",,1
"Park Chul-woo, compared to the past, I have confirmed that the corporate bank account of the credit card, Hana Bank account, and illegal accounts are being used. Since itâs chilly this evening, even if you are not here, for example, if you were affected by a sculpture and cannot come due to being overwhelmed, thatâs not the case. I searched for accounts used for business trips. It has been taken care of. Likewise, since the Lord has no lost driver's license, I will contact you in the future. I am trying to confirm any parts related to the purpose of the transactions made by Sabunim. Where exactly, like the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office, Lee Hyun-min, we have contacted you this way. I called to check whether you are a victim or a perpetrator. I am discussing the case here. This case is currently an ongoing case involving over 220 people nationwide. I have mentioned this. I have asked for details. If there is any way to support you, rather than receiving inquiries over the phone, I am saying that it should be provided formally from the beginning. If you are unaware of the nonsense being said, if you misuse personal information, I have mentioned that it can lead to serious consequences. I understand that you know it's at home, but it's not showing up anywhere other than that, and it has been used. Do you know that you can continue with bank robbery beyond that? I just slept, yes. I usually talk to my boss and I cannot know if they are really there or not. But I have been asked to create accounts at my home. As a result, it was confirmed through the account. How could this have happened? If you do not receive the alert text under your name, you might not be able to make calls continuously. Unless you check your mail by logging into Internet banking and wait for it to be set up, I am telling you that it is strange even to create it this way. It does not come up for me. I use it for sure. I can call you. Do you want to proceed by phone? Just a moment. Hello, I am contacting others sequentially, and you need to make a decision before they contact you. Please let me know. In terms of the time taken, it is something you will also need to receive from the prosecutor after it is done. The time taken might take longer to check where the personal information leak came from.",,1
"No, no, teacher. I believe that person is also not here. My father, around 2013, arrived at the Mystic Apartment, and he might have been receiving treatment through my account. Therefore, I applied to block all my personal information leaks, and I couldn't do it directly for all my bank accounts. The bank has locked everything; it has to be at Hana Bank. Since around the summer of 2013, because of the ongoing issues with my father, I've been keeping an eye on things. I personally go to manage things, and I've been doing so significantly. If you register under your name for loans, it makes it impossible for any living person to be affected, as everything is communicated to the banks. In this incident, there were some problem employees primarily involved, and I did a lottery as a circulation. But regarding the security card reader, it doesn't mean you don't pass it; rather, itâs about where it was created. So I asked whether, from the notes, they personally opened a bank account, or in case the mother's name is used, would the account be opened like that? It's not about having a meal like that; itâs about the situation. Are you currently employed there or are you a student? I'm sorry, but with all the recent voice phishing, thatâs why itâs not coming through. Since there's a lot of time, even if you don't recommend, thatâs okay. I will confirm for you; itâs really fine. Aside from what my father has done, Iâm managing everything else, so I apologize. Can I get your home address and name? Can I call you back immediately? Of course. This is Lee Jung-won, the chief of the Financial Crime Investigation Team at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, not Lee Dong-won. If you ask for money on vacation, I will retrieve it right away. I will call you right now. Thank you very much.",,1
"Hello? What did you say? Yes, yes, you know that the product you used before was a joint guarantee product, right? Ah, yes, yes. From the customer's perspective, currently, your mother is the debtor, and the person you spoke with, Mr. Kwon Oh-joon, is the co-debtor. This is simply how it is understood. Yes, today, the financial institution reviewing this considers both the primary debtor and the co-debtor as joint debtors. In other words, both of you are debtors. Yes, yes. So, at that time, you probably only sent your income verification document. Yes. Therefore, in the banking sector, there are no separate guarantee documents or joint documents submitted by you, so there is no documentation proving your guarantee. Yes, therefore, for this guarantee product, you need to process the refinancing quickly to prevent any changes in debt, and since you helped your mother, you shouldnât put yourself in a difficult position. Yes. So we will request the financial institution to process the joint guarantee product as a personal product in your mother's name. Yes, however, the funds I provide this time are intended for repaying the existing guarantee product. Yes, we will definitely assist in processing the remittance for the repayment of the guarantee product for you. Yes. As for the debtors, after receiving the funds, if your own funds are urgent, and if they do not repay the existing guarantee, there will be risks involved, so the guarantor must bear some degree of risk, but more than anything, it is important to eliminate the joint guarantee product. Yes. We will proceed with the remittance processing to ensure the existing guarantee product is repaid safely. Yes. Your mother has taken out a loan. Yes, yes, we will proceed with that. Today, regarding the remittance review, you should think that both of you will receive calls from two places first. How many places will call? For now, only two places. Why only two? Because the funds your mother needs or the funds for refinancing the guarantee cannot be matched from one place, so you should think that the remittance will be split between two places. Yes, so today, you receive calls from those two places? Yes, thatâs right. After receiving the funds today, if you repay only the guarantee portion of the existing loans, that will be the end of it. Yes, yes. After today, there will be no more phone calls for you. Then you mentioned remittance earlier. The remittance will be made to you... Yes, the remittance itself will come to you, and the money will go to you? Yes, thatâs right. Your mother took out a loan, so what I explained earlier is related to why we will process the remittance to the guarantor. Since we are changing the joint guarantee to a personal product... Yes. The purpose of the funds we are providing now... Yes, Iâm not saying you should take out an unnecessary loan. Yes, the purpose of providing the funds now is the refinancing funds for repaying the existing guarantee bond because... Yes. We will safely process the remittance to ensure the existing guarantee bond is refinanced. Yes. Do you understand? If that remittance is made, what is the next process? Then after you receive the funds, you need to repay your mother directly, or just provide us with the proof of transfer that you have delivered the funds to your mother. Yes. In case you use the funds for other purposes after receiving them, that would be problematic. Yes. So until the funds are delivered, you also have the responsibility to participate as a debtor during the review. Yes. So if you receive calls from Korea Investment or OK Savings, I will explain the review process to you. Yes. Even if it's unrelated to the facts, I will explain the process to you... But wait a minute. I have a question. Yes, yes, you are receiving funds now after going through two reviews, right? Yes. Previously, you already went through five reviews, right? Yes. Oh, so the process is like this: you think of it as two reviews split into first and second, but the previous reviews were for banks or savings banks that werenât registered... So you have already received 25 million won, right? Yes, your mother received 25 million won and has repaid the loans so far. So why do I have to go through two more reviews and receive more funds again? Ah, let me explain. Yes, now your mother has received 25 million won as the first guarantee product and is paying off the credit loan. This is for your verification... yes, but I told you that she needs to terminate her guarantee bond. So I said she has already sent the repayment proof? Yes, she sent the completion certificate, so we are going to process the cancellation funds. Yes. You gave your mother the completion when you provided the guarantee. Yes. So now you have to cancel the existing guarantee bond, right? However, you're wondering why you are receiving calls from two places for the cancellation. The reason you are getting calls from those two places is that we provided funding to cancel the guarantee bond... Yes. And your mother has still not fully repaid the existing loans, so we also have to provide her with the remaining funds, which is why you will be receiving this additional funding today. This means the refinancing of the loan and the remaining amounts will be covered, as I mentioned regarding repaying your bond. What is the loan amount being processed this time? This time, itâs for the existing guarantee product repayable amount of 25 million won. Yes, your mother will be repaying that remaining amount of 25 million and receiving additional funds... So what is the total amount? The total amount you are receiving is 50 million won. However, this 50 million won is not for personal use. Yes, it is intended to repay the remaining part of the existing loan and the guarantee product, and using the additional funds to settle this. How much are you receiving from each source? From one place, approximately 25 million won should be expected. Oh, if thatâs the case... Let me explain something. Yes. I have been receiving calls for a week now, and itâs frustrating... Yes, youâre working... Yes, you should explain things accurately and not just in vague terms. Ah... what is with this? Just receive the calls and sign the papers without any details, what is happening now? Um, so I am trying to explain to you exactly how it is being processed and finalized... but you didnât explain anything. Iâm only getting answers because I asked questions. Am I supposed to ask questions to get the explanations? Didnât you provide any thorough explanations? Thatâs what I mean. Ah, your motherâs situation is one thing, but you should properly discuss the procedures during the work process. People keep being confused. Yes? Look now. You should have explained why you need to receive calls from two places. You just said to expect calls from two places. Yes. Do you think that makes sense from your perspective? Think from the customerâs perspective. Ah~ I thought I had explained everything already. Hah... Iâm explaining this to you one last time, so Iâll explain why the remittance is being made in your name. Why are you going through the process with two places... I shouldnât have to ask all this. But even if you donât mention the calls, Iâm saying that the process will still happen. Additionally, you will receive 2000 each. Yes. Then is there also a joint guarantee involved in that? No, no. Whatâs happening now is not going through a joint guarantee. Yes, the additional funds you are receiving are about refinancing securities in your name and regarding the additional funds for your mother. Itâs just a remittance review process you have to go through. You are saying I have to undergo a remittance review? Yes, we are explaining that we are not withholding information. No, no, thatâs wrong. You didnât provide accurate information. Please communicate with Team Leader Song Sun-mi too. I just canât figure out how this is being handled. Yes, Iâm hearing this for the first time? Ahâ¦ I didnât know that I would be going through two reviews. Yes. Also, I havenât heard about the total amount. Um, itâs not just that Iâm hearing from my parents or my mother; itâs naturally something that the company should communicate. Unfortunately, no one has said anything about this. Yes, yes? Do you know what I mean? Yes, yes. Iâd like to clarify more for you, so... we often work more quickly, and for example, if I need to explain the product concept, it can take a long time if I do it all at once, so I sometimes proceed while explaining along the way. Because when trying to finish quickly... the faster you go, the more detailed you need to explain. Thatâs how people understand and go along with it. Look, if this had been discussed in the beginning, we wouldnât even need to have this conversation with you. Yes. Since I've been on this for a week, itâs frustrating. Ah, thatâs right. From the customerâs perspective, you werenât trying to get a loan. Yes, it seems like you are trying to help your mother, but while working, taking calls must have been stressful. I want to make sure you donât feel that stress anymore, so Iâm giving you a detailed explanation, and to avoid confusion, Iâll walk you through it so you know exactly when you have to stop receiving calls and can proceed smoothly. Yes. Yes, you can think that you will get calls from two places. Yes. So consider it as receiving calls from Korea Investment and OK Savings. You can assume that. Yes. If the amounts donât match, we will work to expedite the processing. Yes. So, initially, as I said, you will receive a call from Korea Investment. Yes. You should first ask the necessary amount. Just say the maximum limit. Youâll have five questions to answer during the examination. If you can recognize that, I will expedite the process. When you are undergoing the examination, I will provide you with simple, brief explanations just regarding the questions they ask. Yes, yes, yes. I wonât give long explanations... Yes, yes, yes. So when you receive the call from Korea Investment, the first thing they will ask is the loan application route. Yes, both will ask. Yes. Then it will be âinternet blogâ. Can you take notes? Just say it. Yes, yes, say you applied after seeing the internet blog. Yes, when they ask for the required amount, just tell them... first state the maximum limit of 30 million won for Korea Investment. Yes. You might wonder why you stated 25 million earlier but now say 30 million. Yes, thatâs part of my tips for the examination. Just because you ask for 30 million doesnât mean you will necessarily get 30 million. Ah... when your mother submits documents, she might make verbal mistakes or negative factors may be revealed and it can lead to a reduction. So for now, letâs set a generous amount of 30 million. Yes. So even if it might not align with the facts, just follow my examination tips. Yes. When they ask how the funds will be used, just say itâs for living stability. If you mention you wonât use it personally and that you'll provide funds to your mother for repayment, it will lead to a detailed examination process, which could delay things until next week. That would be difficult, wouldnât it? Yes. So just say you need it for living stability. Yes, yes, and if they ask whether you are a full-time, contract, or temporary employee, just say you are a full-time employee. Yes. It doesnât matter whether you are contract or temporary; Iâm just telling you how to respond to the questions during the examination. You should say you are full-time. Yes. When they ask about rent, deposit, or owning a house, you already know how to answer from the previous examination, right? Yes. Just answer as is. Yes. If they ask whether youâve received guidance about low-interest restructuring within two to three months, just say no. Yes. In reality, your mother was trying to move from a high loan amount to a low one, but if the financial institutions provide refinancing and then you repay, the amount could still decrease. Yes. So when they ask if you received guidance for low-interest refinancing within two to three months, just say no. There are only two things that should be ânoâ. If they ask whether you are simultaneously applying for other loans, just say no. Yes. In reality, you are applying for loans from other places simultaneously. However, if they say you are applying for other loans, it might not match the amounts, so just say you are not proceeding with anything else. Yes. So you should act like you are only proceeding with Korea Investment at that institution and only with OK Savings at theirs. Yes. Yes, is everything done now? Have you said everything? Yes. So when you are questioned during the examination at OK Savings, if you ask them about this and that, that should not be the case; it might be misinterpreted. Essentially, since your mother is involved, it can lead to confusion during the middle examination as they follow their manual. They wonât know what's exactly been approved at that bank because the process is conducted in that manner, and answering questions there can lead to refusals. So during the examination, just answer the questions briefly, and if you have questions, please direct them to me. So if you have any questions, please let me know until now. Yes, so the examination is starting now. Yes. You mentioned there would be an examination, right? Yes, yes. So this means you are clearly borrowing from that place. Yes. Yes? So this used to be a joint guarantee, but now itâs a precise loan taken from OK Savings Bank... Yes, correct. What is my situation now? Is this also a joint guarantee? No, no. Am I borrowing? You donât have to worry about a joint guarantee relationship here; you are borrowing under your name basically. If you ask how the funding situation is, just say you are repaying the existing guarantee product. Do not mention that you will be taking out a loan. Why? Because you underwent a review for refinancing the guarantee bond... No, what do you mean by that? Iâm asking if you are applying for a loan. That is irrelevant. If you were to receive funds, logically, you would be approaching a closer bank branch. Ah, you would have borrowed a smaller amount from your mother, right? Yes, that is not the case. Currently, your mother took out a loan, so it will technically fall under your name. Because as the sender, if your name or personal information isnât involved, it makes no sense for you to receive the remittance. Therefore, it correctly falls under your name, but after receiving the funds, if you use the money for other purposes, it also reflects your debt. However, this does not mean your case ends there. You must provide documentation proving you gave the funds to your mother, and it should be attached in proof since the money will appear in her account in our system. The re-contracting with your mother will occur, ensuring you have no further issues in the process. Yes, then when will the cancellation proceed? Once the remaining completion is billed, it will go through right away. Oh, I see. Yes, I have explained everything, right? If you have any more questions, please let me know now. During the examination, there might be unexpected variables, or they might ask strange questions, which could confuse you. Ah, if that happens, I will assist you. The examination needs to conclude promptly so that you don't have to take another call. Yes, so just answer the asked questions. Yes, understood. When you answer, present yourself as if you are the one taking the loan. Yes, as I mentioned, for Korea Investment Savings Bank, simply say it's from an internet blog. If they ask about your loan application, just say itâs from an internet blog. When they ask how the required fund amounts, just provide as necessary... Say you received advice from an advisor named Choi Hyun-myung. Let them know the necessary amount, how much do you need? You should say the maximum limit, which is 30 million won, and when they ask how you will use these funds, say itâs for living stability. If you mention points about providing for your mother or repaying for guarantees or anything else, do not say that, understood? Yes. You need to say thereâs no guarantee document youâre using right now. If asked, just say you donât have that. And if they suddenly ask earlier about something odd, you need to answer accordingly. There are two points missing at the very end, and about the rest, just respond appropriately to the given answers. Yes. Lastly, one more question. Yes, how do you plan to cover the funds when asked? You stated it was for living stability, right? Yes. But we explained that these were remittance funds, which go to your mother, so it appears as if it comes to you. So what I mentioned earlier is, if you present it as âIâm using these funds for my own needs.â then again, if you declare youâre providing it to your mother while needing to repay her completion, this triggers a detailed examination process, and we have submitted the application to expedite the examination so you can receive funds for living stability. So this is a stability fund, but itâs being processed under your name now. You will receive it under your name, and once you transfer it to your mother, the transfer documents you submit will affirm that your mother has received the funds, which will be confirmed in our system. Thus, weâll carry on the independent recontract with your mother assuredly without any further inquiry from you. Initially, you wonât need to take any further calls, as officially, everything will run under your motherâs name going forward so that only your mother and I will communicate during this process, which is what I am trying to inform you. Yes, understood. If you have further questions later, feel free to contact me. Yes, the examination phone will go through with Team Leader Hong Sung-mi, and you'll be through the review shortly. Yes.",,1
"Hello, I'm sorry for contacting you due to the frustrating situation, but I would like to ask you a few questions regarding the personal information leakage case. Have you lost or transferred your ID, driver's license, passport, etc., to someone else in the past year? No, there hasn't been anything like that. Then, recently, banks and card companies have been reporting personal information leaks. Have you experienced any damage due to that? The reason I'm asking this is that we apprehended some illegal gambling activities on July 9, 2015. We found a Busan Bank account in someone else's name at the scene. You were supposed to handle the situation yourself, as you didn't have it with you. Did you get it issued from the branch? Was it from the Busan Bank branch in Myeongji-dong, Gangseo-gu, on June 9? If you lost it, would you know the male person involved? It's 12 o'clock. I'm not sure, but they claim to have bought the bankbook with money. Is that correct? As you know, according to the principle of real-name financial transactions, when opening a bank account, you must present your ID in person to have the bankbook issued, right? Just because someone claims they don't know doesn't mean we can't investigate the case. I understand your position, and it can be frustrating, but in this situation, people need a ""straw man"" account for operating illegal gambling sites. Yes, yes, they stated that they purchased bank accounts through contact with 132 individuals. While talking on the phone, some of these individuals are receiving money. This is related to verifying the infected individuals. So, are you the one who sold the bankbooks? Just to let you know, if you transfer your bankbook to someone else for less than 30 million won, you could face a fine. Do you understand what I said? Understood. First, it's significant to connect this case. You need to receive treatment, but are you currently working? Or, how much time do you have left before coming to us? Is it 4 o'clock? We are located in Yeonje-gu, Busan. You need to take at least an hour, so if that's inconvenient for you, what will you do? I may not be able to offer you a meal. To assess the validity of the situation, I will ask you a few basic questions. We will identify you as a secondary victim during this questioning. The investigation process will involve whether you provided false statements; other agencies will review your case, as it will be used as evidence. If you lie or give misleading information... Yes, then I will proceed without recording. One moment, please. Hello? Yes, I am Kim Na-young from the Busan High Prosecutor's Office. I am not a person from 2015. Is this your first time? Are you a male? Do you not know? Do you remember if you opened a Busan Bank account at the Myeongji-dong branch in Gangseo-gu on June 9, 2015? Do you recall where you were on that day? Understood. Did you know that your information was being used illegally before I mentioned it? Then please stay strong. You said you lost your ID and driver's license but have nothing at 130, correct? Understood. I have to continue, but last, I don't know the exact date you referred to. Yes, hello? Yes, you said you hadn't been using it recently but claimed you're using it for work. Do you remember the last date you used it? Understood. Then do you have only one legal account under your name? Please tell me about the legitimate banks where you've received legal funds. NH Bank, Kookmin Bank, Busan Bank, if you mention them in our investigation and find accounts that you didn't open themselves, we will consider those used illegally. We will take necessary action; please remember that. Did you say Kookmin Bank? Do you recall the last date? Ah, is that so? Did you say ""Sung Sang-yup""? Did you carry on well? If so, how much is left in your account?",,1
"In the case of the bankbook, we confirmed through comparison with the relevant financial institution that it is definitely not a forged bankbook but a legitimate account that has been opened. Which bank is it? It is Woori Bank and Hana Bank, and since it was found at the scene of the incident, we had it frozen... (omitted) Do you know a place called Gwangmyeong in Gyeonggi Province? Where? Gwangmyeong? Yes, Gwangmyeong in Gyeonggi Province. The bankbook was issued near Gwangmyeong City in Gyeonggi Province. So you didn't obtain it yourself? No. Recently, do you have your wallet or ID...? No, I don't have them. Have you never lost them? No, among the people involved in this case, there are those who sold or transferred their bankbooks and those who had their identities stolen. Yes.",,1
"Have you perhaps lost a wallet or an identification card that could lead to the leakage of personal information recently in the mountains? Just in case, we have confirmed the connection with the financial supervisory service and the results from your report. Among the individuals involved in this incident, there are indeed some who have received calls from you, and your personal information has been leaked, which has raised many questions. The reason we are contacting you today from the prosecutorâs office is to verify whether you, as a person involved, have sold something under your name or if someone has committed identity theft. In the case of the burning incident, we did a thorough investigation and there were no significant issues, and we are reaching out primarily to clarify the billing matter.",,1
"President, you donât need to personally handle the food. You just need to lend us the debit card connected to your account for a month. Yes, yes, thereâs no need for you to move around directly. If you wish, we will handle the delivery because our club delivers directly. Since taxes are quite high, what Iâm trying to say is that we want to use your account to manage our company's taxes. Personally, you have a friend who deposits money into your account, but that can't all be written off as tax deductions, right? So instead of using the card for payments, we're doing it this way to pay taxes for our company. In return, we also make some profit.  Originally, we provide 267 units per month to our clients. If you send the card to us today, as soon as it arrives at our office tomorrow, weâll check the cardâs password. Once confirmed, we can process the payment as early as tomorrow. If the password is correct and thereâs no issue like losing the cash card, then the payment can be made tomorrow. There are such cases. If you plan to do business with us for about two months, we will ask you to open a payroll account, which would be set up under the name of Cogmo Wife's account, and we'll help you by transferring it to the designated account. Do you have any monthly transactions?  Itâs in Suwon, Gyeonggi-do. Yes, President, just let us know your current location. Youâre working part-time now, right? Just tell us the address or the district in Suwon where you work. If you donât mention the money, and just give us the street number, weâll send it to you via a courier service. We will cover the cost. When it arrives, if the call gets disconnected, please come out for a moment and inform us via text without entering anything else. Just send one message saying youâve received it. Additionally, each person can rent up to three cards, and the credit limit is about an hour.  Yes, yes, might it be difficult to talk on the phone during work hours? Or could you tell us your break time so we can call you at a convenient time? We will try to get the kids to register it as quickly as possible. But please donât just end the call; put the card in a small box or container before sending it. Yes, yes, President, if you have any inquiries, feel free to send a message anytime. Just send it casually, and if you send it, thatâs fine. Iâll also let Director Cha know your name and then inform you via text. Understood. If Chairman decides to proceed, please contact us via text. Regarding the account number for receiving payments,   if you mention that the rent has been changed to the Nonghyup Bank, send us the account number.   Please make and send it. Thank you for the call. Have a good day.",,1
"I just sent this to you. There is a case in Daemyeong 2-dong. I contacted you; are you available for a call? Perhaps you know someone named Kim Yong-sik? I will ask again. He is originally from Gwangju, JeollADO. You might not have heard of it before. The prosecution regards Kim Yong-sik as the main culprit. A large number of credit cards were seized from Jeonggwanjang, and it appears they were used during the holiday season. Two Nonghyup banks were discovered, which is why I contacted you. There was nothing, but we need to see what there is, oh dear, it could be serious. Is your leg hurting? However, it seems that you did not calculate. The reason I contacted you after reviewing is to see if your father sold his bank account or if it was a financial transaction he was involved in. Otherwise, itâs about identity theft due to personal information leak. For now, money has been used illegally in the bank account. Therefore, I need to tell you something. You know the Joonggonara website, right? You donât not know Joonggonara. On the Joonggonara website, Kim Hyun-sik deposited money under the pretext of selling state property in his name.

Now, if you give that amount outside, there might be grounds for a lawsuit.",,1
