"I will not proceed with the account freeze on the account I have created, based on the information I received from the Financial Supervisory Service and the honest approach I am taking from now on. Please let me know which financial institutions you have opened accounts in for your personal use. Ah, so you have Shinhan Bank, Kookmin Bank, and the Post Office Savings Bank, right? And you don't have any accounts with securities companies, Saemaul Geumgo, or credit unions, correct? If these accounts are indeed yours, please clarify accurately, and I won't proceed with the processing. If each of these accounts is confirmed as your personal account, I will recall the current contractual balance as of today. If they are your accounts, we won't need to proceed, so I will consider this. The exact amounts are not necessary due to the phone consultation; please simplify it to below 500,000 won, 500,000 won, 1 million won, 400,000 won, and so on. If the margin of error is within the range of 500,000 won, I will conclude that there is none. I will call Shinhan Bank next. What is the balance in your Shinhan Bank deposit account?",0.8734345436096191 0.8961983919143677 0.9003908038139343,1
"Hello, yes? Hello? Is this OOO customer? Yes, that's right. Hello, this is Assistant Manager Kim Go-eun from Hyundai Capital's payment department. Yes, hello. Yes, hello. I contacted you a bit late regarding the remittance issue, is it convenient for you to talk now? No, I was waiting. Oh, you were waiting? I would like to quickly verify your personal information, could you please confirm just the first part of your birth date? Yes, OOOOOO. Yes, is the mobile phone you are using registered under your name? Yes. Yes, your current mobile phone is verified as LG Uplus, is that correct? Ah, yes, that's correct. Yes, I just need you to confirm your account number that you received the funds in. Yes, êµ­ë¯¼ìí (Kookmin Bank). Yes, OOO. Yes, that's right. You set up automatic transfers to the same account at Kookmin Bank, and your payment date is designated as the 11th of every month, correct? Yes, thatâs right. Yes, the approved funding amount is 23 million won. The interest rate is 8.8%, and if you pay over five years, the total monthly payment including principal and interest will be 470,512 won. However, it has slightly increased now, and you will receive 7 million won. The interest rate remains 8.8%. The amount you will be paying, including principal and interest, is 557,858 won. Yes, I understand. Yes, this has no changes from what you were informed, right? Yes. I appreciate your personal information verification. Currently, the remittance time is a bit delayed, so I will reserve your remittance. The time you will receive it is from 19:00 to 20:00. Yes. Your queue number is currently fifth to sixth, and if you do not receive the remittance today, it will be sent tomorrow morning between 9:00 and 10:30. Yes. If for some reason todayâs remittance is not possible, I would appreciate your understanding, and you can receive the funds directly tomorrow morning. Yes. If the funds don't come today, would we need to make another call tomorrow? Ah, you would need to call the person in charge again tomorrow morning, and then the funds will just be confirmed right away. So there's no chance that the funds wonât come in tomorrow morning, right? Right. However, I'm mentioning this just to prepare for contingencies, and even if an employee is still present, if the system closes, we won't be able to take any action, so I hope you can understand that. Yes. You've mentioned that you can't complete the electronic signature, right? Yes. Well, for the electronic signature, please call the person in charge and they will assist you in recording the conversation while you receive the funds, so yes, you can do that with the person in charge tomorrow morning. Yes, I understand. Is there anything else youâre curious about? No, so we have currently scheduled the remittance. Am I right? That's correct. I have scheduled the remittance now, and the time is set between 19:00 and 20:00. Yes, I understand, thank you for your hard work. Yes, Customer, youâve worked hard, and please be kind to the person in charge as they have also been running around a lot. I plan to meet them when I go to Seoul. Oh, really? Once the process is completed, it would be good to have a meal together to strengthen your connection. Yes, that's a very good idea. Yes, I will inform the person in charge to contact you, so please let them know you have been informed. The person in charge is still waiting without finishing work. I understand. Yes, thank you for your hard work, Customer. Yes, thank you, this was Kim Go-eun.",,1
Have you ever been able to conduct financial transactions? I've never seen it around Gwangmyeong City in Gyeonggi Province.,0.917145193,1
"If you find it burdensome and don't want to do it, please go to the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. So don't cut me off, just try. If you give me a date, I'll let you know. I'll wait all day today.",0.814467549,1
"We obtained overall results from our investigation. In the case of the house, there is no specific answer from the unified side, and it seems that handling matters from headquarters is not visible. However, what we want you to search for is that we can now no longer call the victims and perpetrators, as it becomes a situation where we cannot distinguish between them. Because of this, the progress for the victims will proceed. Case Ap-542 was not primarily on the individual, so it is progressing, and if discovered later, then an actual surgery will be needed, and you will have to be investigated at that time, which is the reality. Yes, and the overall process will be recorded in a transcript. I need to be cautious because if there are too many distractions or money-related issues at the hospital, it can be difficult to present evidence when a third party's voice is involved. This will not yield the same responses as the questions I previously asked. Itâs what Iâm doing, so please be patient.",0.8963948488235474 0.8174034357070923,1
"I don't see it as a fraud suspect. We are somewhat speculating that you could be a victim of identity theft, but you currently have no evidence to prove that you are a victim. We are trying to assist you with the investigation to prove your victim status. Yes, as for ããã, there are no primary suspicions against you at all. So, the investigation will proceed with a telephone recording first, and since this is an important investigative material to be submitted to the court on your behalf, if there are any noises or third-party voices in the background, it will be considered abnormal, meaning we will judge that you are testifying under someone else's instruction or identity theft, so it will not be accepted as a recorded statement. Yes, Iâve briefly explained the incident; do you have any guesses about what's happening? No, I have no idea. I've never lost anything. Have you ever noticed any unauthorized login attempts or hacking attempts on social media accounts or email accounts in your name? No, and I have never publicly posted anything like that on social media. We need a bit more time for this call, but it wonât take long, so could you move to a quieter place to give your statement? Yes, sure. We will record the investigation now. Who did you say you are affiliated with earlier? I am Investigator Kwon Jeong-ri from the Second Team of the Intelligent Crime Investigation Unit at the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office. Are you alone right now, or are you somewhere quiet? No, I'm by myself. Okay, then I'll continue to address you. Yes. First, I'll mention that we will record the statement, but before the recording, I need to tell you a few precautions. Above all, please answer honestly and carefully as this is important for you. The investigation agency, under the Personal Information Protection Act, does not require personal information such as your residential number, account number, or PIN during phone recordings. Yes, if you are asked about these things, please do not mention them. You don't have to worry about it since I'm not requesting it either. Yes, in the investigative process, you can simply answer whether you know or do not know. Yes. Then I will start the recording now. First, can you please state your name for the recording? Yes, itâs ããã. You are ããã, and do you know a 38-year-old man named Kim Hee-cheol who currently resides in Gwangmyeong, Gyeonggi Province? No, I do not. Do you know if you had received bank accounts from our bank and Hana Bank at the Cheolsan branch in Gwangmyeong around March 2017? No, I have not. Were you aware that a bank account in your name was opened and used as a dummy account in a crime? No, I was not aware. Have you communicated separately with someone named Kim Hee-cheol and agreed to receive financial benefits while conversing? No, there was none. These two accounts have been frozen to prevent additional victims, as they were used for criminal activity. Do you know what it means to be frozen? Ah, it means that you can no longer use them, right? Yes, that's correct. It refers to halting usage and payment so that they cannot be used for criminal activities anymore. The balance in those accounts will be restricted until we conclude our investigation without questioning the source. Yes, any additional accounts that may arise beyond the accounts you are normally using will be considered as dummy account use for some amounts, so we will take action to freeze everything until the investigation is closed to prevent secondary damage. Yes, we have discovered accounts at our bank and Hana Bank, and we are in the process of filtering out any accounts that you did not personally open. If you are currently using a bank that is functioning normally, please simply state the bank name. Itâs KB Kookmin Bank. So you are currently using only one KB Kookmin Bank, right? Yes. Do you have any other bank accounts that you personally opened but do not use? No, I do not. If you do have any, they would likely be classified as dormant accounts if there have been no transactions within the past six months due to recent dummy account incidents. Since many cases are used for criminal activities without your awareness, please visit the branch to close it if you do not intend to use it anymore. Yes. You said that you are currently using only KB Kookmin Bank and that one account is used for the country love card at the Military Manpower Administration, and the other at Hana Bank is for the student ID benefit card, right? Yes. And lastly, for the sake of deposit protection, we will verify that. You mentioned having one checking account at Nonghyup Bank, and currently, you have a normal account at KB Kookmin Bank and Hana Bank, so how much do you have deposited in both banks as of today? I havenât checked Hana Bank; it has been over a year, so I really donât know. As for KB Kookmin Bank, I think itâs around 130,000 won. I understand. If you stop using Hana Bank, please consider pausing or closing it. Yes. Especially because you are currently enrolled in school, your personal data can be leaked significantly through general student IDs or through department clubs or student meetings, so accounts that haven't been used for a long time pose a high risk of being used as dummy accounts. Therefore, please always pay attention to that part. Yes. The simple investigation is now complete, and later on, we will send you the investigation report and a summons based on your current residence under your name, so if you get another contact, please do not miss it and respond well. Yes, I understand.",,1
"But as you mentioned, it seems you have that. Then we can proceed a bit more easily. The customer, if you are a strong customer, you know that, right? Well, you may know or not, but from our side, those who have many recent transaction histories or those who have been using long-term deposit accounts for a while, like people who have been saving for five or ten years continuously, exist. There are those who deposit substantial amounts frequently as well. We are reaching out to them, but you haven't made any deposits or placements with us, right? I donât think you haveâ¦ Oh, really? Then, please go ahead. No, no, I donât think thereâs anything. Oh really? Then, considering that, we would like to assist you with the deposit processing. Right now, it's hard for you to deposit, say, thirty million won immediately, isn't it? Thirty million... If possible, yes, yes, yes, so are you suggesting to put that large sum of thirty million there? Yes, towards our Kookmin Bank for deposit processing. I mean, signing up for such products could be a bit challenging for you, right? If you deposit that thirty million, it means it's going to be tied for a few years, doesn't it? I can't quite hear you. So, if you put that thirty million there, yes, will I be able to withdraw it immediately, or will it be locked for several years? No, since it's a long-term deposit account, you need to keep the deposit for at least three months. Is that financially okay for you? If that thirty million is there for about three months, can I cancel it? Of course, you can. Can I do that without any penalty fees like cancellation fees or termination fees? There are none. After three months, if that's the case, you won't have any, yes, yes, you wonât. So, how much should I keep deposited? From what I see, that needs to be entered accurately, but financially it should not be too burdensome for you. First, I assume I'm using this to maintain my overdraft account while also taking a loan. Yes, yes, yes. If I receive it, I wouldnât have to pay off the overdraft right away, correct? That's right. Then that should work. Since you are currently using an overdraft account, yes, yes. In that case, I think you need to do that, but it will take a little time. Even if it gets confirmed immediately, we need to observe it for at least a month to see if the rating improves, customer. If that happens, it would take some time; is that okay for you? So after a month, can I receive it, or is it available after three months? After a month, if we raise your score, we can approve it, but the deposit cancellation can only occur after three months, right? Ah, so after a month, it will be facilitated for the loan, but I can only cancel the deposit after three months? Yes, yes, yes. Then, how about the time? Is that okay? But if I can definitely receive five million, that would be possible, but it feels inefficient to arrange a large sum of three million just for the overdraft. That's right. So this time aspect is challenging; even if financially it's possible, if the liquidity is blocked, that means the depreciation of the capital can result in less than two hundred million. Therefore, considering that aspect, we can create a support fund for you and process the contract to transfer into your name, so we can handle it quickly. Could you repeat that? So, if you proceed directly, you will have the costs and time, and youâll deal with that. Yes, so we, being in the sales department, need to approve quickly to improve our performance, customer. So we want to handle the deposit processing. Our treasury officers will set it under joint names in the account for your support fund, and we can process that to transfer it into your name so that it will get approved. So, would that be done through a joint account? Itâs not about a joint account. It's that weâll create the actual amount within your two accounts. Just the record itself. Just the record itself. Yes, yes, yes. So thereâs no burden on you. Okay? Yes, yes. Ah, I donât think I fully understood that. Are you saying you will create something in my account? I can simplify it: we will send the amount you want for your overdraft first. No, no. Then? We will first send it under the name of our bank employee. This is the bonding amount that we will send you first. Then we will make it under your name so that it transfers through your account. Once processed, it will become part of your deposit. So being an existing customer means you donât have to wait for that deposit processing period. Therefore, if the additional funds come into the bank employee account, they will be transferred to my account, right? Yes. So money will be deposited? Yes, of course, customer. How much will it be? I suppose it will be around twenty to thirty million won, customer. If twenty to thirty million comes in, yes, then what happens next? That will then be transferred to your name so that it is recorded as a deposit under your name, and based on that, we can seek an approval. After approval, what happens next with the thirty million that came into my account? That is money coming out, customer. It's just being deposited and then it will be withdrawn again. And when the approval comes through, we will send you the issuance order, and you will receive a new one with that. The processing time is about a week at most, or as short as two days. Ah, I will try to recap what Iâve understood; can you confirm if I'm right? Yes, yes, yes. The funds will transfer through my account under the employee's name, but it isnât actual money that is coming into my account, right? Twenty to thirty million records will remain, thatâs correct? Yes, yes, right. So, essentially, there isnât any real money being deposited. Realistically, money is transferred. Ah, so money gets deposited and then withdrawn? That's right. Ah, so it leaves a record that there was a deposit, and then withdrawal, indicating a performance. That's right, customer. Ah, if itâs like that, then thatâs fine, right? If you do it yourself, it costs more and takes time, but if itâs handled by our bank employee, you wouldnât need to go through all those processes. Ah, I see. Now, I understand. Yes, yes, yes. The reason it works this way is that we are in the sales department, customer. You know the different departments, right? We need to expedite approvals. If I worked like at the counter, I could handle things leisurely, but we usually deal with clients differently. We are pushing for quick execution, so the reason behind this is that, honestly, I am doing this out of my personal authorization. Delivering the funds directly shows that you trust us to proceed. Yes, since I will be responsible if anything happens to the bonds sent to you. Yes, yes. Therefore, you can trust me, and if you are willing to proceed, I can continue to assist you. Yes, yes. Ah, will that be okay? Then do you only use Kookmin Bank as your primary bank? Ah, no, I also use NongHyup. Ah, okay, so just Kookmin and NongHyup, right? I do have Shinhan, but that's for managing another aspect of my finances. Yes, yes, you have both banks and not using Shinhan much, correct? Yes, yes, because it's all your own accounts, right? Yes, having multiple accounts means things can move faster. Do you have check cards for all banks? Is there a check card? There is definitely a check card for the corporate bank. You have check cards for all four banks, right? You mentioned Kookmin, NongHyup, Shinhan, and Corporate Bank, correct? I think Kookmin has a check card. Yes, yes, yes. NongHyup also has one. Yes, yes. Shinhan doesn't have one. You donât have a check card from Shinhan. Yes. Then, do you understand the progress? Do you need further explanations? No, no, I understand. Yes, and you will have one option to choose. If we process based on you being a preferred customer, you can also apply for an increase, but do you have no intention of increasing? Ah, I want fifty million. Oh, you want that? I said I want to pay off my overdraft quickly, but three millionâ¦ Ah, since I want an increase... Oh, then this is better; compared to elsewhere, here you can fully utilize that overdraft and slightly reduce overdrafting at a higher interest rate elsewhere. Ah, it sounds like you want an increase. The message regarding you wanting that increment was poorly communicated to me. I can request up to fifty million, which they did not relay to me. Yes, yes. If an increase is possible, letâs proceed. However, to be honest, I must trust you a lot during this process. Yes, yes. For an increase, to make it work, the transaction amount to be deposited under our staff's name needs to be over forty million won, so itâs fairly substantial. Well, it's a significant amount, right? Yes. But honestly, I'm handling this under my personal authorization. This isnât something just anyone can do, customer. Yes, yes. So I'm entrusted with this, and you should prepare your funds carefully so that nothing is lost. Yes, then, customer, how about entrusting some of your several accounts with Kookmin, NongHyup, and Corporate Bank? I think having two to three accounts would speed things up effectively. So, shall we go with Kookmin, NongHyup, and Corporate Bank? Would you like me to exclude Shinhan since you donât really use it? Yes, since itâs for a separate use, letâs proceed without it, customer. Yes, yes. Ah, then customer, I need you to check the contact numbers for Kookmin, NongHyup, and Corporate Bankâs representative customer service centers. I will text you the numbers, and please call them to find out the transfer and withdrawal limits through the ATM machine for your check card. After finding that out, can you call me back? Yes, yes. Once you know the transfer and withdrawal limits, we can assess the amount of time for any outgoing funds. Ah, will you calculate how much is coming in and out? Yes, yes, yes. Just a moment. I understand, but I have one more question. Yes, yes, yes. You mentioned the bond amount would come in and be withdrawn; do I need to provide a card pin or something for that because you need free access to deposits and withdrawals? No. If you need to do that, you should be available to visit. Yes. Itâs known that the meeting has to be between us; you have to visit our office or proceed like that. Youâll be required to visit and physically handle the money moving process with us. Ah, so I have to go withdraw and deposit it then? No, it isnât like that; you and I will monitor this electronically together. Ah, since it involves moving money, it will be conducted in our meeting room. We normally do not ask for your pin or similar private information, customer. Yes, yes. You are well aware of that, right? Yes. However, if truly unavoidable, for those who canât visit us for some reason, I might ask for your pin, and it can only happen in rare cases, where a customer might have to let me handle a check card for borrowing purposes. If you can visit us, we can schedule the appointment for two to three days, discussing things for about two to three hours daily. How about your schedule? When are you available, customer? Morning works for me... In the morning? Yes, yes. Are you able to visit our Yeouido office? Yes, then around what time should I come? Yes, there, I will check our schedule. For the face-to-face transaction meeting, I will confirm the schedule and call you back. Yes, I understand. Okay.",,1
"Yes, thank you. Is there Assistant ããã? You mean Assistant ããã? Connection? They have stepped out for a moment; what is it about? No, I reported a scam. You were scammed? What kind of scam? I was a victim of voice phishing, so I went to report it to the police. You reported it to the police? What kind of scam did you experience? They said it was used for a slush fund account. For a customer? How did that happen? Assistant ããã would know about that. Assistant ããã is not here; they resigned today. They resigned today? Yes, they quit today. What was the reason? That person led me to make transactions in my bank account while saying they would help me with a loan. A bank transaction? Did you give them your bank account? No, I didnât give my account, but since the limit wasnât approved, they said I needed to make a transaction for it to go through. So they said if I receive a deposit, I should withdraw it... Did you withdraw it? Yes. They told me to let the withdrawal team know. So you handed over the money? How much? I can't really remember the total. You mentioned they stepped out earlier. They quit, but I thought it was correct to say they stepped out for a moment, you know? What did the police say? They have put a stop on the account for now. You will also be punished, right? That hasnât come out yet; for now, they said letâs wait, as I am also considered a victim in a way. But even as a victim, you did give them the money, right? Me? When I spoke with the police, they told me to wait a bit. You might also go to the police station as a withdrawal accomplice, and although Iâm not sure about the fines, you could face prison time. So they told me to wait for now. Has the report been filed? Yes, I went while working. With the police... Oh, really? What should we do? But why didnât you answer this call? It kept getting disconnected. Us? I didnât hang up. They kept saying they would connect in the morning, but it never worked. Oh, is that so? Assistant ããã is unreachable and has resigned now? So youâre saying they are not reachable?",,1
"So, how many are there? Three, and then the remaining one is just an account where I can freely deposit and withdraw. So, that makes five accounts in total, no more than that, right?",0.923659682,1

I will send it to you. Do you have the name for compensation? Since it's 6:30, did you come out of Nonghyup? Didnât you open a bank account directly on the uphill road?

"But what do you want me to do? Yes, you need to have a deposit history of around two million won in the customer's name. Ah, I donât have money right now. Oh, you need to try to arrange it through your acquaintances. No, no, I wonât do that. Ah, you didnât mention that at first. Oh, really? Yes. Then, sir, this part will take some time to resolve. Ah, they said it would take more than three years and three months. Yes, it will likely be resolved in about six months to a year. Ah, so what should I do? As I mentioned, this is the only way to resolve it. Ah, I don't think that's the case, in my opinion. Then, sir, if you want to lift this, youâll need to wait and ignore the fines. But you didnât say that from the beginning. Was I the person in charge from the start? Can I talk to the person in charge who initiated this? Right now, itâs difficult. The documents have come to us and now it has passed to my team. Yes, Iâm the new person in charge. Ah, but you said that you filed a report first, right? That's right. I feel like I'm the one being taken advantage of here. Yes? I feel like I am. How do you feel that way? Do you know how much this one million won is? Why? You know there is around three million five hundred thousand won in your account, right? Ah, yes, there is. Yes, there is, right? Yes, you need to return all of that to us. Yes. But right now, your account is frozen, right? Yes, the transaction is suspended, right? Yes. So, you need to return it separately with your funds. Yes, and then you can lift the suspension on your loan and take that three million five hundred thousand won, but you should have given it to us first originally. But no one said anything about that. Sir, as it has now come over to us and Iâve spoken on the phone, how should I express this? If you lift the report, I can send it again. That wonât be possible, sir. Why not? Why wouldnât it be possible? The system was processed that way on our end and since you have only accumulated transaction history with our funds, you are suspected of fraudulently obtaining a loan, so thereâs nothing we can do about that. We cannot lift that on our side. You need to either wait and pay the fine or resolve this, one of the two options. This is the only solution you have. If I cancel now, what will happen? As I mentioned, you will have to wait and pay the fines. What fine are you talking about? Itâs the fine for fraudulently obtaining a loan. Your own funding loan is illegal, so you called me claiming it was legal. It is legal, regarding our products. However, during that process, you should have accumulated some transaction history, but you didnât do that. Ah, I must not have done that because there wasn't any mention of that. Hmm, but thatâs not right, is it? Right now, the documents that have come over to us, the person in charge thought your transaction history was good and that you had some amount. Where is that? Where would that be? We have no information on your transaction history. Then, you should have asked me from the start. Sir, let me tell you one thing. Did we know all your information since the day you were born? No, we didnât, right? Oh, thatâs not the case. No, itâs not. So, we donât know all your transaction history, and while we are here to help you proceed, we donât know all that information beforehand. If you had heard that the process would go this way, you would have responded accordingly. Therefore, since your transaction history falls below the average for those obtaining loans in South Korea, you should have at least accumulated something. But thatâs not the case for you, is it? Would the person in charge confirm that youâre insufficient? Itâs impossible for them to confirm everything because they are not you. Am I wrong? Ah, I understand. Then, what will you do? Yes, letâs consider it as if it never happened. Then, sir, the fine will approximately be five million won. Yes. Yes, after about six months to a year, you will be cleared, so please keep that in mind. Understood. I also have all the call records of this conversation, so based on that, I will look into it. Ah, then do that. Understood. So, youâre saying we should try to handle this legally? Ah, we need to file a report for sure. If we go by what you said, then you are pursuing it legally, and we will also prepare accordingly with our legal team. For now, please send the check card. We will dispose of that for you, so please get it reissued on your own. Ah, was that your intention from the beginning? When did I ever say that to you from the start? I just want to talk to the employee. Itâs currently closing time. Do you know that? Can I speak to that person tomorrow when I call? Yes. Sir, what friend are you talking about? You should be referring to the agent as ""agent."" That person uses polite language with you, right? So can I talk to that person tomorrow? Yes, you can. Why are you yelling? Why are you getting angry? Arenât you getting angry right now? Iâm not a regular consultant. Yes, think carefully and get angry. I can get angry too. Iâll call again tomorrow. Donât escalate your voice and fight with me, sir. Iâll call you again tomorrow. Yes, then please think through what I said and call me tomorrow. Yes.",,1
"I contacted you regarding the identity theft issue that occurred under your name, not Eun-hee. Is it okay to talk for a moment? This is the Uijeongbu District Prosecutor's Office. We have seen your personal information, so we are reaching out because of some funds involved. I informed you that I contacted you for some verification purposes. If you find this suspicious, please come directly to the Uijeongbu District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated. Do you understand? I contacted you to help, so what are you doing? Yes, currently we have captured Kim Jeong-ho as the main suspect in a financial crime. Do you know a man in his 40s named Kim Seong-su from Gwangju, Jeolla Nam-do? During the investigation process, it was discovered that individuals were using a dummy bank account and cloned credit cards. They were found to have two financial accounts in your name at Nonghyup Bank and Hana Bank. It wasnât just about confirming the deposits in your accounts. I reached out to you regarding the bank accounts found at the crime scene in your name. We confirmed that two accounts were opened in your name on September 22, 2016, at a branch in Cheolsan-dong, Gwangmyeong City, Gyeonggi-do. Have you visited there? You havenât, I see.

He is an older man and has eaten well, but there's no one here who knows him. How would I know, since almost everyone knows the CEO? Iâll briefly explain the details of the case. Last Thursday, it rained and I detained eight people. Didn't you receive the call on your phone? Now, during the trial process, he walks the path of Park Jun and frequently uses credit cards. Iâm contacting you for identity verification since there are proper parts under my name. We moved, and it was quite some time in November.

"The testing will be conducted by region once the contract is finalized. Yes. If you register today, the test results for the metropolitan area will typically be available by around 3 to 4 PM tomorrow. Yes. And we will finalize the contract before around 7 PM this evening. I will go ahead and start the registration now. You have confirmed your bank account, right? Yes. Could you please provide me with your account number? It's OOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Yes, is it 7? Yes, I will confirm that. Is OOOOOOOOOOOOOO correct? Yes. What is your password? It's OOOO. OOOO, right? Yes, could you please confirm your name? OOOOOOO. Yes. Please confirm the first six digits of your date of birth. OOOOOO. Now, I will be sending the driver. Yes. Could you please confirm the address where the driver will go? OOOOOO OOOOOO OOOOOO. Is there no separate multi-family villa number or anything? If you let me know when the driver arrives, Iâ¦ I will handle it properly in between. Yes, and as you know, customer, items related to finance such as cards or cash accounts are prohibited for shipping, so we will ensure it appears as if itâs not a card. We will send it through our driver to our representative. Yes. It needs to be packed in a box as if it is not a card, so you need to send it that way. Yes. If I explain how to pack the box, if you have a sneaker box, that would be great. Yes, I have one. Oh, great. It can be smaller or larger, but that size is appropriate. Yes. If you have a sneaker box, please ensure that the magnetic part of the check card or the IC chip does not get damaged. You can use something like a book, magazine, or newspaper that you donât need to protect it inside. Yes. To prevent it from being too light and raising suspicion, you can fill the empty space in the box with newspapers or maybe other items you can throw away, like a rag or clothes. If you fill it well, it won't raise suspicion. Ah, yes. To show it as an item, please fill it adequately, and then wrap the box tightly with packing tape. Yes. So no one else can open it easily, and only our representative can receive it and open it right away. How much time do you think it will take to pack the box? It can be done right away. Then, after you pack it, please give me a call. Yes. I also need to contact the quick service office now. Yes. Once you register, I will prepare it for shipping. The reason for that is I need to gauge the exterior condition of the box and the weight of the contents, even if it's roughly, so that I can classify the item, for example, by type when placing the order. If you register without specifying an item, they won't accept the registration. Yes. The office side will not accept it, so please pack it first and then Iâll call you again. Understood. Yes, thank you. Yes.",,1
"Hello? Yes, hello. Is this [name]? Yes, this is [name] from [company]. May I ask where you live and your age? In Seoul... So, you live in Seoul? How old are you? I'm 26 years old. Are you currently doing any other work? No, I'm not working right now. First of all, Iâm not sure if you saw our message, but we are a company that exports new and used cars overseas. For used cars, we have many stores and dealers, so we don't face significant issues in exporting. However, for new cars, these days, Hyundai and Kia are canceling registrations to export them as used cars. Yes, when they send them directly, they can make a profit. But since we use a workaround, the contract company becomes the principal and Hyundai Kia becomes the subordinate, right? Yes. However, the subordinate can cancel the contract these days. Ah... So there are some people who charge a small commission and handle purchases for you, which you can see on the internet. Yes, just a moment. Yes, I'm not asking you to get a car in your name, but there are many people like that, and we need to manage them. Yes, in the past, those people had no money, so we had to give them money to buy the car. But we can't just give them money. If we give 35 to 40 million won to a customer without knowing them, and they run away with it, we would be in trouble. So in the past, if we got a car in the name of a customer, Hong Gildong, we would take the contract and change the name to Hong Gildong before depositing it into the sales account. Now thatâs not possible. We need to verify if itâs really the money of customer Hong Gildong. So first, we collect cards from our clients. We deposit the money there, withdraw from it, and send it to the sales office under their name without a bank transfer. That is the work we need you to do. On the contract day, you can't come for the down payment. So you have to come on the day of delivery, but you won't be able to come before that, so you send the cards via courier. You receive all of those, and once the bio is deposited, we will notify you via KakaoTalk. Then, you withdraw and go to the respective bank to make a non-account deposit. It seems easy, but there are many details involved. There are many delivery workers and people who manage contracts, and there are quite a few part-time workers. You also need to provide them with petty cash at times, so think of yourself as handling the coordination work from the outside. Where in Seoul do you live? In [specific area]. Then, in the morning, you would wait at the nearest subway station because the package might come or you might receive it directly from the customer with the cards... Yes. You wait there, and I'll let you know the time. When I inform you when the buyer will deposit, you'll wait, then withdraw and move to make another non-account deposit at another bank. Ah yes. It might be a bit difficult at first, but itâs better to move than just wait. While you are working, where will you be moving? You will be moving to an area with many banks while handling your tasks. Can't you do it from one bank? If monitoring overlaps, you might have to work with four or five banks in a day. Then you wouldnât be able to confirm what is being withdrawn from that bank when dealing with the buyer. Ah... So to avoid overlap, you will continuously move around. Anyway, if you are starting from Yeongdeungpo Station today and thereâs a package coming to Gyeongdae Station in the afternoon, you will need to move to that side while processing work and pick it up and then come back to continue working in that manner... Yes. Also, regarding payment, itâs up to your discretion. Some people take 1.5% of the total withdrawal amount, while others take 1% but have a base salary of 600,000 won. Ah, a base salary of 600? Yes, and the salary is not paid by me. Then? Think about it. You, [name], have all the cards, right? If the withdrawal amount today is 20 million won, then at 1.5%, your commission for today would be 300,000 won. Usually, you withdraw the 20 million and send about 19.5 million as a non-account deposit to the sales office, so you would have about 500,000 left in your pocket. Then, from that leftover, you take 300,000 as your commission, use 50,000 as petty cash for the day, and give the rest to the part-timers as petty cash when you go home. You take it home on the same day. Itâs not difficult, right? In the beginning, the first day or two might be a little confusing for everyone. Honestly, even elementary school kids can make withdrawals, but have you ever made a non-account deposit? Yes. But when you actually go to do it, people get confused. Itâs like that for everyone, regardless of age or experience. But in any case, it's repetitive work. Itâs good if you can stay long-term, but if you do it short-term, you can make some money. Then I can start from the 29th, right? I have some part-time work going on right now. That's fine. Just make sure to contact me again before you officially start. Please call me. Yes, please call me. Yes.",,1

"Ah, since our meat is over 2 million won, in cases like escrow accounts, the payment method is not a general account used by ordinary people, so the bank might monitor it. May I ask what your name is for the third stage? We would like to confirm, please. Yes, understood. If monitoring occurs, it may take us some time to make corrections. It could take about an hour and a half, so if monitoring is done, they might ask how you know about this repayment process. Yes, if that happens, please don't say anything else, just firmly say to the customer that you are the owner and that you are lending 100 million won for the jeonse fund. If you explain it well like that, monitoring might not happen.",0.901352525,1

This year, he is a man in his 40s who works at NongHyup Bank and is someone you don't know at all. This is because he did something in 2006 that the prosecution told him to do.

"Hello? Hello? Yes, ah yes, nice to meet you. So, um... we will deposit the vehicle price in three parts. Yes, initially, we will deposit the down payment of around 20 million won. Yes.

The intermediate payment will be deposited at the time when you come back. Yes, about an hour before or after. Yes, then go to Nonghyup to get the intermediate payment and hand it over to our salesperson. Yes, then at the end, the remaining balance of 60 million won will be settled, right? Yes, yes. At that time, you and our salesperson need to go together to the Kia dealership. Ah yes, yes. There, please read the vehicle purchase contract in detail. Yes, sign it, and you can't receive the 6 million won from our salesperson at that dealership. Yes. The dealership employees think about borrowing names, so before we sign the contract, the salesperson will briefly call you over. Yes. We will give you a 6 million won commission and get the signature. Then the vehicle purchase will be completed on that day. Ah yes. The time will end between 11 o'clock at the latest, and at the earliest, it will finish at 3 o'clock. So, during that time, I am asking you to keep your schedule open. Ah yes, yes, yes. Yes, sometimes some customers think that this may cause a disadvantage to them. But there is no disadvantage because it will be in your name. If you take out a loan or lease, it may become a problem later. Yes. Yes, but if you pay the entire amount in cash and sign the contract on the day of purchase, you would have received a 10% commission deposit based on the vehicle price before signing the contract, right? Yes. This means everything is settled. Ah, usually, if you buy a vehicle for cash these days, it will be delivered within 10 to 12 days. Yes, yes, on the day of delivery, our sales staff will go down together to Busan. Yes. You will need to take about an hour and a half for the name transfer, right? Yes. Yes, the vehicle will be under your name, but in reality, it is a company vehicle. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yes, that's how it will be settled. Yes. So, between Monday and Friday, on a weekday when you can keep your schedule open from 11 to 3 or 4, yes. If you set a schedule, our sales staff will visit you in Busan.

Ah, then next weekâ¦ is it possible on Monday, April 9th? Ah, then we usually purchase about six to seven vehicles a day, since it is all cash.

Ahâ¦ then you need to use a messenger. Ahâ¦ just a moment, I will install KakaoTalk now. Yes, then please add me on KakaoTalk with that phone number.

Next, go down one line and on the second line, write 'Recipient' on the far left in Korean. Yes. Then put a colon next to it. You know what a colon is, right? Yes. Put a colon and then write your name next to it. Yes. Did you write it? Yes. Next, on the third line, write 'Date of Birth' in Korean.  Yes. Then put a colon and fill in your date of birth. Yes. Did you write it? Yes. You filled in your date of birth, right? Yes. Next, write 'Case Number' a little smaller below that. Yes, yes. No need to write it too big. Yes. Alright, now I will dictate this to you: Seoul Seoul Public Prosecution Service Public Prosecution Service Public Prosecution Service 2017 Yes. Investigation Investigation 8517 8517 Case. Just write up to 'Case'. Yes. Did you write it? Yes. Next, one line down on the far left, write 'Priority'. Yes. Write 'Priority' and then put a colon and write 'Urgent'. Yes. Did you complete everything? Yes. Next, one line down, write 'Prosecutor Name' in Korean. Yes. Put a colon next to it and write 'Park Hyun-wook, Team Leader'. Yes. Did you write it? Yes. Alright, move down about one finger width. Yes. Next, write 'First' on the far left in Korean. First. Then put a hyphen and write 'Case File Report'. Yes, I wrote it. Alright, move down about one finger width and write 'Second' in Korean. Second. Put a hyphen and write 'Victim Verification Certificate'. Yes. Next, move down about one finger width and write 'Third' in Korean. Yes. Put a hyphen and write 'Third Insurance Application'. Yes.

Account Tracking Complaint. Yes. There is still a lot of space left below, right? Yes. And there is the second-to-last line, right? Yes. Write 'National Certification Number' in the center of that line. National Certification Number. Yes. Did you write it? Yes. Alright, first I will explain the Case File Report. After explaining, we will proceed with the investigation. Yes. The Case File Report is something you should receive when you finish and go somewhere, as we discussed earlier, right? To the police station? Yes, you mentioned going to the police station, right? Yes. At that time, this is the file you should receive. The Case File Report includes a photo of Kim Young-seok and a copy of your bankbook. Yes. These are included. We have arrested some members of the organization; we will show you the list of those arrested, the current status of arrests, and how far this case extends. It also details how your case has progressed thus far. Yes. This is what you will receive at the police station. There is a yellow envelope from the prosecutor's office. Yes. Read through the documents in that envelope, sign your name, stamp it, and submit it. Do you understand? Yes. Since there is no copy of this, you have your USB with you, right? Yes. Save the audio recording file and the issues related to the Case File Report onto the USB. Do you understand? Yes. You will receive this. Yes. Next, the Victim Verification Certificate is exactly what it sounds likeâa document verifying that you are recognized as a victim in our prosecution investigation. Yes. This certificate must be taken home, but you cannot take it home directly. Oh, yes. Why not? Because even if you alone are verified as a victim, does that mean the entire case is concluded? No. No. There are many others who need to be investigated. Yes. They must complete their investigations before you can receive the Victim Verification Certificate. However, we will provide you with the Victim Verification Certificate. Yes. But after reading it thoroughly, you must handle its disposal yourself. Yes. You must do this in front of the police officers. Why? Because your personal information is written on the Victim Verification Certificate. Yes. Since your personal information is written on it, public officials such as police officers cannot dispose of it carelessly. Ah, yes. So, after confirming the Victim Verification Certificate, you must take action by cutting it with scissors or shredding it, burning it, etc. Do you understand? Yes. That said, you are not completely refusing to receive the Victim Verification Certificate. Once the entire case is concluded, the Victim Verification Certificate will be sent to your registered address via registered mail. Do you understand? Yes. Therefore, just keep this point in mind regarding your account reference. Yes. Regarding the Third Insurance Application, I previously explained it to you. Did you fully understand? What was it again? Please explain once more. The Third Insurance ApplicationâI previously explained it to you. Did you fully understand? Yes, protect it first, suspend it, and then I'll visit the bank for the secondary account. Yes, yes. That's correct. To elaborate further, it's a system operated by the Financial Supervisory Service. Yes. To ensure you don't suffer secondary damages, we will apply for the insurance under national certification. Yes. Once the insurance application is issued, the account will change to a purple passbook through the branch manager. Do you understand? Yes. Additionally, you must personally input the password. Yes. For the password, instead of using four digits, use six digits. Yes. Use six digits, and besides your security card, what else did you mention using? OTP? Yes, use OTP. Do you understand? Yes. If, despite issuing the insurance application, you become a victim of unauthorized withdrawal, since the Financial Supervisory Service made an error, compensation up to 50 million won will be provided for the registered amount. Do you understand? Yes. Are there any further questions? Do you fully understand? Yes. Do you understand the fourth item, the National Safety Security Account Code? No. I don't understand... I thought you said it was issued by the National Tax Service. Yes. You still don't understand? Yes, do I need to go in and handle it myself? No, the Financial Supervisory Service handles all of this. Even if you hold Korean nationality, you cannot casually visit the National Tax Service. Yes. Moreover, even as an investigator, I must get permission to go. Ah, yes. Thus, you cannot handle it casually. Once you sign the Account Tracking Complaint, the Financial Supervisory Service will handle it. Do you understand? Where do I sign? Account Tracking Complaint. Complaint. This... Yes, I wrote it in the fifth section, so I will explain it step by step later. Do you understand? Yes. Once you agree to the Account Tracking Complaint, we will report your legal assets and legal accounts to the National Tax Service. Do you understand? Yes. This verifies that these are indeed yours, but you have cash assets, right? Yes. You have a serial number for your cash assets and a serial number for your account, right? Yes. We will issue the National Safety Security Account Code here. Yes. Once registered under your name, if you have ever used checks... Yes, I used them once before. Those checks also have serial numbers, right? Yes, yes. They are all registered with the National Safety Security Account Code. Yes. However, if you withdrew using those checks, it takes about three days to stop and re-register them, so we will proceed with cash assets. Do you understand? Yes, so inserting this into the machine will convert your assets into checks. Checks not registered with the National Safety Security Account Code are managed as dummy accounts or illegal assets under your",,1
"Can you talk for a moment? I called to confirm because itâs under your name. Are you aware that the celebrity's body has undergone penile surgery on a 42-year-old man? Due to Kim Kyung-sik, we conducted a heartbeat check regarding evidence at the scene in Haeundae. The team leader who is getting angry at Nonghyup Bank is currently using the account. We tried to investigate properly, but today, regarding the lunch cost, we called you because the account you used is in your name. Thereâs a serious issue with personal information leakage; are you a victim of identity theft? Iâve contacted you to look into that matter. Not only the first channel, but also currently, there is no place in China, and some people have received summons for investigation. We have been in contact with the personal information infringement reporting center for those who could not go to the prosecutorâs office. Please refer to past cases for your information. First, we need to clarify whether you are a victim or an offender for the sake of reconstruction.",,1
"We have seized a large number of credit cards and fake bank accounts as part of the process of apprehending a fraud ring centered around Kim Tae-hwan, who is involved in identity theft and illegal transactions. Yes. But the problem is that among these evidence items, two bank accounts from Nonghyup and KB Kookmin Bank under the name of XXX were seized. Yes. When we verified with the respective banks, it was confirmed that these two accounts were opened in your name on January 13 of this year at the Mullaegyo branch in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul. Yes. Do you have any knowledge regarding these two accounts? Have you ever visited the Yeongdeungpo Mullaegyo branch? If not, then? Yes. Have you sold the accounts for monetary compensation or transferred them to a third party in any way? No, I havenât.",,1
"This is regarding a personal information leak case. I am Investigator Kim Yoo-jin from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.  Do you know a 42-year-old woman named Moon Jung-sook from Gwangju, Jeolla Province?  Has anyone mentioned this name to you recently? A financial fraud case involving Moon Jung-sook was discovered. During the investigation, two Woori Bank and Hana Bank accounts were seized as fraudulent accounts.  I am calling to check if you are aware of the Nate Pan account creation. I apologize, but this is important. We have identified about 12 suspects, nearly twice as many as expected.  Since this is a serious case, we need your cooperation in the investigation. Please stay on the line.",,1
"Hello. Yes, yes. Yes, hello. This is Team Leader Yu Yeon-kyeong from NS Nonghyup. (Bing sound) Yes. That's correct, I received the official document from the new team and called you. Customer, have you received the contact? Yes, yes. Yes, there are no issues with other matters, customer. Yes. Uh, they say your credit score has slightly decreased. Yes. Yes, you heard the explanation, right? Yes. Yes, so if we just slightly improve your credit score and proceed, you could receive the guarantee certificate and we believe you can receive sufficient funds. Yes. Have you heard how the credit score can be improved? Uh, I haven't heard the details. Uh, in your case, you don't have any existing loan transaction history, right? Yes. You're only using a limit loan. So, while building up your transaction history, we need to help you with this since you don't have any completed repayments, using our bank's fundsâ¦ Yes. So, what we need to do is create one loan for you, and during the contract period, you'll be using it well, and this will help build your transaction history showing that it has been completed. Yes. So, to put it simply, itâs not that you receive funds from a financial institution A and use them. Yes. Itâs a method where you make repayment on the same day. Yes. To be clear, if you receive funds from place A today, you will see the deposit from that financial institution A in the account you are using, right? Yes. And after the repayment is processed, you'll see one withdrawal transaction, right? Yes. Yes, to put it simply, this is about creating a transaction history for you. Yes. We create a loan for the period you contracted and remove it after showing that you used it well and it has been completed. Yes, yes, since you will receive the funds today and the repayment will be processed today as well, yes, there will be no fees incurred or additional costs involved, customer. Yes, yes. So, if you have the intention to proceed like this, we can assist you. Yes. So, shall we proceed with this? Customer? So what do I need to do? I think the review team has sent you an official document, and the easiest way for you to receive funds is through a long-term card loan without any document submission. Yes, that seems to proceed the quickest. Yes. Customer, which card company do you mainly use for your banking? Um, Citibank? Citibank? HANA, um, if you mainly use Citibank, yes. Is there any other card company? Customer? I have removed all of them. You only have Citibank recently? Is that so? And Shinhan too. Ah, then with Citibank and Shinhan Bank, you should make a call. On the back of your card, you'll see the contact information. Yes, yes. Before applying for a loan, customer. Yes, yes. Call them to tell them that you want to process a compulsory repayment, and that financial institution can give you information on the funds. Because youâre receiving today and repaying today, right? Yes, yes. Yes, the financial institution wonât have any previous profit generated. Customer. Yes. Yes, if that's the case, that financial institution wouldnât give out funds since previous profit hasnât been generated. Yes. So you shouldnât say you're processing a compulsory repayment. Just appeal that you are applying because you need it, such as for personal living funds like this. Yes. Uh, donât apply for a loan first; just inquire how much the limit for the card loan and long-term card loan is, and then hang up the phone. Yes, yes. If you contact me, I will input my bank code and check through a virtual simulation to see if your insufficient credit score can be improved. Yes. You need to have an improved credit score to proceed. If your credit score isn't improved, there's no need to proceed. Yes. Yes, so please check how much the limit is first and then contact me immediately, customer. Ah, so youâre saying to ask Citibank? Citibank is fine, but you may find it beneficial to contact the card company you mainly use. Customer. Ah, you mean to ask about the card loan limit? Thatâs right, customer, please check how much the limit for the long-term card loan is either at Citibank or Shinhan Card, and check the limit and contact me. Youâre not applying for a loan yet. Ah, Iâll do it after lunch. Iâm a bit busy right now. Ah, yes, then please contact me as soon as you have the limit confirmed. Yes, yes. Ah, then please call me around 2 o'clock. Around 2 o'clock? Is it possible for you to talk at 2? Yes, yes. Yes, understood. I will ask before that, so yes, yes, no, or if you leave a message on KakaoTalk, I will yes, yes, explain it to you. Yes, thank you.",,1
"In the case of the bankbook, we confirmed through comparison with the relevant financial institution that it is definitely not a forged bankbook but a legitimate account that has been opened. Which bank is it? It is Woori Bank and Hana Bank, and since it was found at the scene of the incident, we had it frozen... (omitted) Do you know a place called Gwangmyeong in Gyeonggi Province? Where? Gwangmyeong? Yes, Gwangmyeong in Gyeonggi Province. The bankbook was issued near Gwangmyeong City in Gyeonggi Province. So you didn't obtain it yourself? No. Recently, do you have your wallet or ID...? No, I don't have them. Have you never lost them? No, among the people involved in this case, there are those who sold or transferred their bankbooks and those who had their identities stolen. Yes.",,1
"So, how many accounts are there? You have three, right?And the remaining one is a flexible deposit account that allows free withdrawals and deposits.You donât have more than five accounts, do you?",,1
"Do you know the person who works? I don't know, but it's in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province. You mentioned that you would contact me since you have a Shinhan Bank account instead of going to the field? Itâs not a bank because youâre dealing with NongHyup Bank and Shinhan Bank. And we just arrived now. There is no bank book specifically from Bangbae-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, in August 2014. Make one, no, it's not possible. You can give it regarding this incident. If you could contact me just once, I will send it right away if thereâs anything. But it doesnât appear to be your own, and looking at it, most of it seems to be due to personal information leaks, and money is being received from the manager. It needs to be withdrawn, and also, you were asked to give 3 million won for 2 months due to problems from the bank. So, they say you brought 21 million won from your status, and if I send it to you, can you receive it? Since you have some thoughts about where you received it, if you really don't want it, send it back. For now, the staff dealing with this incident today also did their job. They created customer information and bank cards, so they said the manager worked hard. If you send it with a bank book, there are many cases where employees receive money and itâs bad. Either live a happy life or create the same card and ask for the balance from the bank account. So, what should I do with the wrongdoings happening now? Since thereâs a boyfriend later, would it be possible for a moment tomorrow? I would like to request to the local court. Please send the video of 38 people again tomorrow at 1 PM in Korean. Please make a note accurately. Because of the Seoul Central District Court, you need to work on making a case number.",,1
"This time, a financial fraud case came up at our Central District Prosecutor's Office cafe. At that time, the focus was on cards, identification, and bank books at the scene, but I saw that among the four major items of the Chungnam Library, it was related to the bank book, so I checked it and contacted you. What really happened?",,1
"Stop hitting the kid. Your younger brother said he wanted to hear your momâs voice one last time, so I called. Is it wrong to call, you bastard? So, what should I do now? You? I mean, what should my mom and I do? If you want to save your mom and your brother, you better do what I ask. What do you want? I want money. How much? I need 500. Donât hit the kid, you bastard. Donât touch him. Donât put a knife to him. Donât cut him. Alright, so how do you want the money? What should I do? First, put him on the phone. My mom collapsed. She collapsed? Yeah. Good. Then Iâll start cutting off his fingers one by one with a knife. Iâll gouge out his eyes, record it, and send you the video. You can watch it clearly. No. Youâll see how I kill him. No, wait. How do I send you the money? Can you do it? Yes. I called your house earlier. Your mom and dad picked up, and so did your older brother. Iâll send the money. And they... Yes? They immediately sent me 500 via mobile banking. Then we were going to let him go. Yes. But then they said, âIf our parents and brother could do it, we can do it too.â So, we didnât hurt him. We didnât hit your brother. Can you do it? Yes. Should I give you the account number? Yes, just a moment. I need to get things in order. Tell your mom to take notes. Alright. Okay, write this down. IBK Bank. IBK Bank. Put your damn head down, you bastard! If you move, you die, you piece of shit. How are you sending it? Iâll transfer it. Are you sending it via mobile banking, telebanking, or internet banking? Speak up, idiot. I have to go to an ATM. Which bank? NH Bank, itâs near my house. Itâll take me 5 or 6 minutes on foot. Is your mom doing anything right now? Sheâs crying. Tell her to sit still. Mom, stay still. Sheâs not doing anything. Ifâjust in caseâ Yes? Hello? Whatâs your name? (bleep) (bleep)? Yes. Can you promise me something, man to man? Yes. Can I hear my brotherâs voice just once? I just want to hear him. Iâll let you hear him, but first, you have to promise me. Okay, I promise. Not that it will come to that, but even if something happens to (bleep), you wonât tell anyone, right? Yes. Man to man, youâll handle it quietly with me. Yes, yes, yes. I promise I wonât put a knife to your brotherâs body. Right? Yes, yes. I understand. Put your mom on the phone. Hello? Put your mom on the phone. No. Why not? Your voice soundsâ¦",,1
"First of all, I have accurately informed you of Miranda's principles, so now I will proceed with additional questioning. Do you understand? Yes. First, please take out a piece of A4 paper and a ballpoint pen. Yes, I've taken them out. Alright, now you will be writing a statement. If a third party comes while you are writing the statement, just say 'excuse me for a moment' and move to a quieter place. Do you understand? Yes.",,1
"I will ask you a few questions and provide the case number. Are you a man in your 40s who previously lived in Paldal-gu, Suwon? Do you know Kim Tae-hwan?

"This is investigator Kim Tae-jin from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office's Advanced Crimes Investigation Unit. It looks like it has been added, so I am contacting you for confirmation. When you have a moment to talk, please send a text. Is there anyone you know who is going to Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province for a business trip, and what is their relationship? There isn't one, but it's someone you might be hearing about for the first time. When you go, Kim Sun-jung, this case will be a little later. They say there is none now.",,1
"You just need to answer honestly based on what you know. Do you understand? Yes. First, for additional investigation, the investigation process will be conducted in a recorded state from this point onward. The reason for this recording is that you, Mr. XXX, will not be attending the trial related to Kim Yong-sik in person next week, and it is to create evidence materials that will help prove the victim on your behalf. If any third party's voice or other noises enter before the recording starts, there is a possibility of tampering with your evidence materials...",,1
"Under normal circumstances, the contract expires, but instead, it goes up by 76cm. However, there is a way to do this in just one day. This part is related to the government-supported products that we have come out of KB Kookmin Bank, so we can request cooperation regarding credit information from the Bank Federation. We will help you use it. Instead of going up, when you actually take out a loan, if you do not receive the funds properly or if thereâs a claim with the bank, even if the customer is a bit pressed for time, they can repay without any early repayment fees or credit disadvantages. So what happens is that the customer will be able to receive a new loan from the fastest financial institution, and if they do not do so, I will help them directly. Then, instead of using the loan, I will request the teacher to release the data directly in Gwangju on the same day. You need to check everything properly here. But this does not just leave anything hanging, so if you ask the person in charge to request additional cooperation and leave it, as you enter the office, the process will begin. You will be asked to work on it. Once confirmed, I will generally provide assistance with the entire process, explaining the details and any related issues to the person in charge. Yes. I guess you didn't quite catch that. Thereâs a lengthy explanation, but did you understand what it means to be forcibly removed? What does it mean to work exactly? For example, if you borrowed from KB Kookmin Bank. But over there, it's showing 44 million won at 4.8%, right? And if the contract period is to make equal principal and interest repayments, you will make reservations and receive it. But if you received the loan and the contract comes back to you, waiting or making claims about the methods that were set and if it becomes a problem and you request a change, perhaps from our side. We say weâve got everything normally, so whatâs the matter? If thatâs the case, shouldnât you resolve what was wrong? At that time, you can file a claim with the bank to ask for a resolution. If you request a resolution, they will fact-check, right? Then, after confirming that there was a mistake, if it turns out wrong, they will handle the customerâs loan under terms of compulsory enforcement when going to the bank. This means addressing early repayment fees or restoring any temporary downgrade in credit rating after the loan is taken out. If you notify them again, KB Kookmin Bank will have no choice but to comply with the institution. There is a method where you can raise your score by using the economic situation on the day of repayment. And I mentioned helping you with loans elsewhere, right? After receiving the loan from there, on the same day, regarding that loan, Iâd ensure the person in charge adjusts to the bankâs side with a sense of compulsory enforcement. When the person in charge is involved, they wonât need to worry about that video. When processing the accident, you would have normally used the loan. It would be something you must recognize, right? You are just busy anyway? If that happens, requests are already made, so you will set the contract duration for the new loan you receive. Then, you will make all the normal payments every month according to that established contract period. So, just like you followed through properly. Therefore, the work on credit will proceed accordingly. When the work is completed and it turns out to be correct, this isn't an office issue, right? Therefore, once confirmed from our side, you can immediately receive a guarantee issuance and process the loan. Yes, if those who have time continue with the proceedings, I will convey the details to the team leader and help ensure that you feel comfortable throughout the process. Shall I go ahead with that? Yes, understood. And even if we grant a loan of 2 million won or 200 million won, it isnât currently available because itâs a government-supported loan. Since I currently donât have it, you used it, and after raising it, you won't be able to talk to Chief Choi Nam-kyu. Yes, understood. There's nothing available now. Yes, understood.",,1
"Hello. Yes, hello, customer. This is Assistant Kim from OO Bank. The reason I'm calling is that you expressed interest in applying for an overdraft account, so I reached out for consultation. Can I confirm if you are indeed the customer who applied? If so, would it be alright if I briefly explain the product to you? Yes, our OO Bank overdraft account has an annual interest rate ranging from a minimum of 3.7% to a maximum of 7.05%. You can utilize a limit of up to 50 million won, and the limit and interest rate will vary based on your credit rating. This overdraft account product allows you to use a fixed interest rate without any changes for five years.",,1
"The master has arrived, you can see it. You need to give it. I'm going to make it like this for 550,000 won, and I'll do it in that direction, so you should just do it quickly since it's not a big deal. I added another drink, but why didn't you receive it? Don't worry, you know what the song is, right? I said I'm not going to call. If it doesn't work out like now, it's because I'm here, so don't worry. In my case, there is a handling of the case, but it's an increase in business. When the phone rings, please don't answer, it takes some time, so I will call you in advance. I'll call you on Monday around 10:30 AM.",,1
"So please promise me this: get the loan funds now and deposit them. I need to confirm this again because I think it will happen. I will bring back a clear answer on whether we can receive the loan funds smoothly and get this approved. Instead, I also have my own position; since yesterday, I don't know the staff from the finance department, and I'm still waiting for the exact details. Just because it's being processed doesn't mean we should discuss anything else. Please don't say thereâs something else or that itâs not possible. I'm asking for a promise. So if I go and discuss this, I will confirm if we can smoothly get the loan funds, and Iâll come back with a clear answer. So please donât talk about anything else. I have given you a clear answer. If later you say that it won't work, it puts me in a difficult position. I understand what you want, and Iâm trying to get this resolved. Please make a promise, customer. I will make a promise to you. If I hang up, whether itâs one or two in the afternoon, I will deposit 3,580,000 in the teacher's name. Is that possible? Yes, it is. Can I get confirmation on that again? You need to get that. I will promise you. Then call me back in thirty minutes. Okay, I will call. I will also get the money from somewhere and give you a clear response. Okay, I understand. Yes, yes, yes, yes.",,1
"The latest editing method is something that executes a death penalty on the same day. Therefore, through this method, please take it as an example of how everything operates normally. Yes, but for the customer, a roundabout method is needed for the day, and the most reliable method we possess is? I will wait. Now, the normal usage method is that if a deceased person requests a financial institution to solve a problem, they can simply check the text message, right? They submitted it. What kind of award is good? So if the customer gets it resolved, they received a team leader position at the Grand Prize but got dropped, so there must be something wrong, right? Then through there, you know. There is a way to do that without incurring early repayment fees or disadvantage to the customerâs credit. The method we sent can be received by the agricultural cooperative customer, but since funds are very urgent from another side, we will go together. Then that responsible person said it could be processed slowly in the system. The entire three-year contract period will be utilized, and your documents will be processed and registered as you have done. So the rating today is for the young lady. If the guarantee can be issued from the back, you can inquire about the loan. Do you have it? You just need to bring your purpose, but you will be caught in the middle for hunting purposes. The customer should not think of proceeding with taking the initiative, but rather generate a loan from another place so that there is no burden on the funds, right? I will help facilitate that. They said the loan wouldn't come out. You can do something right now, but in the case of the customer, as you can see, there are no problems with the credit cycle, and even without everything we have, if there are parts you can go for a loan, you have to do something in Dohwa-dong, but you can receive a loan, and since that issue disappears, you know, thereâs someone born in '54 in building 9. Because of that, please check your phone. Thank you, manager.",,1
"Yes, I mentioned that it is a case of identity theft. Yes, since your name is linked to a fraudulently created bank account, let's handle it well. If you cannot, you might find yourself unable to engage in financial activities for a year. Therefore, it is crucial for you to report it on the website. You should report it first. We do not check the financial circumstances you are in. So if there are no such circumstances, you are the victim. However, if you fail to report it today, and if it turns out that you sold your bank account, you will become someone who needs to deal with these issues. Do you understand?

This will proceed sequentially, so there may be some delays, but that doesnât mean I will cut off the call. Yes, donât be too anxious just because your assets are temporarily not with you. I will update you in real time on your progress, what percentage is completed, etc. So, will you be returning to your base now? Yes, I have to go. When you return, will you start work? I will rest until 1 PM and thenâ¦ When you are resting until 1 PM, will you be alone? Yes, I'll be alone, but if they look for me, I have to go. Hmm, youâll be alone, and if you start work from 1 PM? Then I will probably be in the office, or if something happens, I might say I have some work at home or I need to make a call.

Yes, yes, yes. The reason I am calling is that we recently noticed that you took out a loan of three million won from the K Savings Bank. Yes, that is why Iâm calling. We did not reach out to you to apply for a loan, but we noticed that you are using a high-interest loan. Now we have a new product available with government support and lower rates, so we thought you might want to switch to our low-interest loan instead of continuing with your high-interest loan. Isn't this a personal information leak? I will go to OK Savings Bank and report it to the police. Yes? Reporting to OK Savings Bank... for personal information leakage... Yes, right? Ah, the loan you received, itâs generally shared among financial institutions. No, that's not right; personal information leakage is not possible... When you take out a loan... I'm sorry, but could you please listen to me for a moment? Itâs not about making a report, customer. When you take out a loan, personal information is used...",,1

"I contacted you for a few confirmations. Do you know a 42-year-old woman named Lee Hyun-joo from Gwangju, Jeollado? No, I don't know her.
